# Tokyo Style Noodle

This is a good, all-purpose noodle, usable in many different ramen applications.
You can cut it with a standard 1.5 mm cutter, or thinner. It can be crinkly or
straight. It works with most soups. It’s also relatively easy to make compared
to other styles. 


## Ingredients (per portion)
 
* 99 g King Arthur bread flour
* 1 g vital wheat gluten
* 1 g egg white powder
* 38 g water
* 1 g salt
* 1.2 g baked soda, or powdered kansui (if using powdered kansui, use 0.5 g
  sodium carbonate, and 0.7 g potassium carbonate)
* optional: pinch of riboflavin (a literal pinch, less than 0.01 gram is all
  that’s required)


## Steps
 
1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water (and riboflavin if using), dissolve
   completely. If using both sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them
   one at a time. Go slowly, stir constantly until clear. This will take a
   while, but eventually, the contents will dissolve. You can make the solution
   several days before to get a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight
   container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour, wheat gluten,
   and egg white powder. Turn the mixer to “stir” and run for 30 seconds to
   aerate the mix. 

3. While running the mixer on stir, add two-thirds of your water mixture slowly,
   in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 3
   minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for another
   minute, until small clumps begin to form.

5. Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let
   this rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Don’t skip this.

6. Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going
   through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and
   fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet
   it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and
   not ragged. 

7. After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30 minutes.

8. Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired
   thickness, using potato or cornstarch as you go to prevent sticking. 

9. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. 1.5 mm by 1.5mm is standard for
   these. 

10. Bundle the noodles into 130 g portions and place them in a sealable bag. Put
    the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day.
