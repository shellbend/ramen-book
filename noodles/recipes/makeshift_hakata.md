# Makeshift-Hakata Style Noodle 

These are "makeshift" because most Hakata style noodles are very low hydration
(<30%), something most home cooks can't do. But they'll still have some
similarity to the real deal; they're very toothsome and cook quite quickly.
These noodles are particularly hard to make, so try them out once you're more
comfortable with a Tokyo approach.

## Ingredients (per portion)
 
* 99 g Bread flour
* 1 g vital wheat gluten
* 35 g water
* 0.5 g baked soda, or powdered kansui (if using powdered kansui, use 0.1 g
  sodium carbonate, and 0.4 g potassium carbonate)
* 1 g salt

## Steps

1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water, dissolve completely. If using both
   sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them one at a time. Go slowly,
   stir constantly until clear. This will take a while, but eventually, the
   contents will dissolve. You can make the solution several days before to get
   a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour and wheat
   gluten. Turn the mixer to "stir" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix. 

3. While running the mixer on stir mode, add two thirds of your water mixture
   slowly in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for
   5 minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for 2 minutes.

5. Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let
   this rest for 2 hours at room temperature. Don't skip this.

6. Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going
   through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and
   fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet
   it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and
   not ragged.

7. After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30 minutes.

8. Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired
   thickness with the pasta machine, using potato or cornstarch as you go to
   prevent sticking. 

9. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. 1.0 mm by 1.0 mm is around
   standard for these. 

10. Bundle the noodles into 120 g portions and place them in a sealable bag. Put
    the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day.
