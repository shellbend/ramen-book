# Jiro Noodle 

Jiro noodles are defined by a few main characteristics that are highly
unorthodox for ramen making:

1. Jiro noodles are almost entirely made with a specific brand of flour from
   Nisshin Seifun Group called "Ooshon", a higher mineral flour with high
   protein content. Chances are you can't get this flour, so we'll use bread
   flour with a small amount of whole wheat to mimic the effect of a high
   mineral flour. The resulting noodles will be a light tan hue.

2. Jiro noodles are low hydration, typically 33%, and thick. As I mentioned
   earlier, anything lower than 36% is often too difficult to work with at home.
   I found 36% made the dough easier to work with without impacting texture. Add
   more water as desired. The noodles will be extremely firm, and they will take
   a long time to cook. 

3. Jiro noodles are cut oblong, typically rolling the dough wider than the
   openings of the cutters. This creates a frayed effect on the exterior of the
   noodle that is good at picking up soup (but bad for the cutters, so don't do
   this often!)

## Ingredients (makes a small portion, multiply as needed)

* 94 g King Arthur bread flour
* 6 g whole wheat
* 36 g water
* 1 g powdered kansui (60% potassium 40% sodium)
* 1 g salt

## Steps

1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water, dissolve completely. If using both
   sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them one at a time. Go slowly,
   stir constantly until clear. This will take a while, but eventually, the
   contents will dissolve. You can make the solution several days before to get
   a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add flours. Turn the mixer to
   "stir" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix.

3. While running the mixer on stir, add two thirds of your water mixture slowly,
   in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 5
   minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for 3--5 more
   minutes, or until the crumbly dough does not leave flour residue on your
   hands when you touch it.

5. Turn off the mixer and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close the bag,
   place it on the ground, and step on the dough to compress it into a flat
   sheet, then let this compressed dough rest in the closed bag, for one hour.
   This dough is low hydration and hard to work with without stepping on the
   dough, this jumpstarts some of the structure.

6. Press the dough, taking portions of the dough from step 5 and, using an
   electric pasta machine, sheet the dough. Start with the largest setting, then
   the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and fold it, sheeting under the 2nd
   widest setting, then fold it again and sheet it under the widest setting.
   Repeat this until the sheet is smooth and not ragged.

7. After pressing, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30--45 minutes to relax the gluten.

8. Pull out your dough. Roll out to desired thickness with the pasta machine,
   using potato or cornstarch as you go to prevent sticking. I roll these to
   about 3 mm.

9. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. Given the above, I use a 1.5 mm
   cutter, standard with a Marcato Atlas. At this thickness, the noodles will
   fray as they exit the cutters.

10. Bundle the noodles into 180 g portions and place them in the sealable bag.
    Put the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day. This is a
    LOT of noodles per person. Feel free to adjust as you like
