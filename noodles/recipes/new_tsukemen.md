# New Tsukemen Noodle 

This noodle uses different flours to achieve a unique, slightly translucent
appearance. It pairs well with lighter broths. 

## Ingredients
 
* 30 g King Arthur high protein flour (14.7% protein by weight)
* 70 g Swan's Down cake flour (9% protein by weight)
* 40 g water
* 1 g baked soda or powdered kansui (60% potassium, 40% sodium)
* 1 g salt
* optional: pinch of riboflavin (a literal pinch, less than 0.01 gram is all
  that's required)

## Steps
 
1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water (and riboflavin if using), dissolve
   completely. If using both sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them
   one at a time. Go slowly, stir constantly until clear. This will take a
   while, but eventually, the contents will dissolve. You can make the solution
   several days before to get a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight
   container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour. Turn the mixer
   to "stir" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix. 

3. While running the mixer on stir, add two thirds of your water mixture slowly,
   in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 3
   minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for another
   minute, until small clumps begin to form.

5. Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let
   this rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Don't skip this.

6. Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going
   through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and
   fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet
   it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and
   not ragged. 

7. After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30 minutes.

8. Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired
   thickness using the pasta machine, using potato or cornstarch as you go to
   prevent sticking. 

9. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. 2.0 mm by 2.0 mm is nice for
   these, but you can also go thicker. 

10. Bundle the noodles into 180 g portions, and place them, in the sealable bag,
    in the fridge and allow them to rest for at least one day.
