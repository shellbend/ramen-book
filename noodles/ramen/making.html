<h1>Making Noodles<a class="headerlink" href="#making-noodles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Now that we know the main ingredients, how do you combine them to make noodles?
The methods are almost if not just as important as the ingredient selection.</p>
<p>To illustrate the method, we’ll start by going over the primary steps.</p>
<p>The following process is derived from several methods I’ve seen, both from
professional manufacturers as well as from other amateurs. For noodles with high
hydration (above 36% the weight of the flour being used), this method works
quite well.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>As of this writing, I’ve yet to be able to make a noodle
consistently with hydration below 36% at home. Industrial manufacturers in Japan
can buy specialty flours that are milled finer, which can absorb less water and
can purchase expensive presses that can apply a very large amount of pressure to
the dough. Home cooks rarely have access to this kind of flour or technology.
For the sake of the recipes in this book, all hydration amounts will be 36% or
more.</p>

<h2>Step One: Ingredient Prep<a class="headerlink" href="#step-one-ingredient-prep" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we even do any form of mixing, we need to get our ingredients in order. I
like to combine all of my ingredients into two separate mixes.</p>
<div class="section" id="dry-ingredients">
<h3>“dry” ingredients<a class="headerlink" href="#dry-ingredients" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="wet-ingredients">
<h3>“wet” ingredients<a class="headerlink" href="#wet-ingredients" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>salt</p></li>
<li><p>riboflavin or food dye (gardenia-based pigment is common in Japan)</p></li>
<li><p>other additives (Some folks add alcohol or sorbitol as a preservative, I
don’t. Fresh eggs would also be included here.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Weigh out and combine the dry ingredients, either in the bowl of a stand mixer
with the paddle attachment, or a food processor with the processing blade.</p>
<p>In a separate vessel, weigh out your water.</p>
<p>There is a particular way I add other wet ingredients to the water:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>First, add alkaline salts</strong>: Alkaline salts, particularly sodium carbonate, form
small bonds and clump together if added to water quickly <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../zreferences.html#id11">13</a>]</span>. These clumps
prevent dissolution. The easiest way to avoid this problem is to add each salt
one at a time, slowly, in an even stream, while stirring the water
continuously. The water will start cloudy, but eventually turns back to fully
transparent with enough stirring. If the salts do clump, they’ll still
eventually dissolve, it just takes longer to stir into solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next, add (sodium chloride) salt</strong>: This salt will take a bit more time to
dissolve. Be patient, it will fully dissolve eventually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finally, add colors or additives</strong>: Riboflavin in powdered form will take even
longer to dissolve. It’s just not very water-soluble. Just keep stirring.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve combined the wet and the dry, you’re ready to start making the dough!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-two-partial-hydration">
<h2>Step Two: Partial Hydration<a class="headerlink" href="#step-two-partial-hydration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unlike with Italian pasta, ramen dough is pretty low in hydration. This means it
is of the utmost importance that the flour is hydrated evenly, so that the dough
comes together easily later on, particularly for the home cook. If you’re making
the dough by hand or using a standing mixer, splitting the addition of water
into parts will help assure that the dough is evenly hydrated.</p>
<p>In a vessel like a bowl or standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients for around 30
seconds to aerate them and make sure the dry ingredients are combined
thoroughly. For me, this is “stir” on the standing mixer.</p>
<p>While the mixer is running on this lowest speed, add around 2/3rds of the wet
ingredients in a slow and even stream. At first, it’s going to look clumpy,
messy, and uneven. But stir for around 3 minutes, it’ll start to combine into a
sandy texture. Sand is good. Sand is great.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-three-remaining-hydration">
<h2>Step Three: Remaining Hydration<a class="headerlink" href="#step-three-remaining-hydration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the dough has that sandy, even texture, you can add your remaining liquid.
As done before, I like to add the remaining liquid in a slow even stream.</p>
<p>At this stage, let the mixer run, but keep an eye on the time. If you mix too
much, the gluten will be so active that the dough won’t come together easily. So
I like to mix for <em>no more than a minute</em>. As the mixer runs, the dough will start
clumping together. This clumping will also essentially knead the dough clumps as
they spin in the mixer, quickly building dense balls of dough. Once the wet and
dry are fully mixed, you’ll have a crumbly mess of dough, it will be unlikely to
come into a cohesive ball of dough. Folks call this “soboro,” a term meaning
“shreds” or “clumps.” That’s ok; ramen dough is crumbly by nature. It doesn’t
have a lot of water. 1 to 2-inch pieces for most doughs is a good sign. To
compensate, we need to go to the next phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-four-the-first-rest">
<h2>Step Four: The First Rest<a class="headerlink" href="#step-four-the-first-rest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You’ve added a bunch of water to a dry starch, spun it around, and developed
some stringy gluten. You’ve also incorporated air into the mix by tossing around
the starch and water. Now you have to stop doing anything. Leave the dough
alone. Don’t touch it.</p>
<p>I know, it seems counterintuitive. But this is absolutely required.</p>
<p>Cover the mixing vessel with plastic wrap, or store the dough in an airtight
container, and leave it on the counter for a while. At least 30 minutes.
Sometimes an hour. If you’re short on time, you can stick it in the fridge and
leave it there overnight.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Resting has several major benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>reduce the rigidity of the gluten in the dough</strong>: Because the mixing we just
performed partially kneaded the dough, the gluten strands have become
“active”. After being exposed to force, the gluten in its current form makes
the dough springy, tough, and difficult to roll out. Just like with other
doughs, you need to let this dough rest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>even hydration</strong>: Your dough is low hydration. The water and alkaline salts
need time to mingle with the starches and flour, something that, with higher
hydration, isn’t as much of a problem. There’s just more water to move around
to do the job when you have pizza or bread dough. But for ramen noodles, that
isn’t the case, the starches have less available water and therefore won’t
hydrate as quickly. You’ll notice when you next handle the dough that it feels
wetter than when you covered it as a result of giving it that time to hydrate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>degassing of the dough</strong>: the dough is filled with both large and small air
pockets. These pockets can disrupt a strong, tightly packed gluten network and
a rigid starch gel that’s integral to the structure and texture of the dough.
If you have way too much air, these pockets also expand in cooking (as heat
causes air to expand), creating a spongy texture in the final dough. By
resting, you essentially let gravity and capillary action force out small
bubbles in the dough. Noodles, as a result, will appear more translucent as
air is forced out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>begins enzymatic activity in the dough</strong>: enzymes in the dough get to work
once the flour is hydrated. In ramen, we care specifically about proteases,
which start snipping the chains of gluten into smaller pieces. When this
occurs, these pieces are effectively primed to be stitched back together into
longer, stronger chains of gluten when kneaded. While this might seem
counter-intuitive, this enzymatic activity improves the strength of the gluten
in the long term.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s critical either way. Rest your dough!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-five-the-first-pressing">
<h2>Step Five: The First Pressing<a class="headerlink" href="#step-five-the-first-pressing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Taking the crumbly dough, it’s time to do the first pressing. Get a batch you
can handle and press into a thick sheet you can eventually stuff into a pasta
machine.</p>
<p>You should have a pasta machine for this. As mentioned earlier, ramen comes from
heavy industrial processing, with massive rollers. We don’t have this, but we do
have pasta machines!</p>
<p>Some manufacturers, like Sun and Yamato, suggest pressing by no more than 30% of
the previous thickness. So if your initial dough thickness is 2 millimeters, you
should decrease the thickness by no more than 0.6 millimeters per pass. I’m not
at all sure where this number comes from, but your pasta machine likely has
these ranges built-in. Don’t sweat it.</p>
<p>Take the thick sheet, and roll it through your widest setting. Press it between
the rollers if you need to. It’s going to look ragged and terrible. Don’t worry
about it, just try to keep it together. Roll out to the 2nd, and then the 3rd
largest setting one by one.</p>
<p>At this stage, fold the dough over itself, and run it through the 2nd largest
setting. This is called “compound pressing,” and essentially gives you more bang
for your buck. You’ll then repeat this process another time, folding in half,
and then running the dough through the largest setting.</p>
<p>The dough needs to go through the machine in the same direction. Folding should
always happen through the middle width of the sheet. The reason for this is
that, in this rolling technique, you’re aligning the gluten to run horizontally
through the sheet of the dough. You’ll notice this effect as you roll, the dough
will have white lines running lengthwise as your dough rolls and becomes more
cohesive.</p>
<p>This adjustment of the gluten network means that, upon eating the noodles, your
teeth bite perpendicularly to the gluten network, rather than along with it.
Much like biting into a steak that’s cut with the grain, the dough will feel
considerably chewier and more robust. This structure also has the benefit of
helping make sure that the starches gel closely together.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for doughs with more water, you can also throw the dough into a
plastic bag and step on it a bunch but… that always felt a little too crude for
me. Some shops do this believe it or not. But the goal here is to develop gluten
fully, get the starches to connect nicely and to have something you can roll out
into noodles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-six-rest-it-again">
<h2>Step Six: Rest it (AGAIN)<a class="headerlink" href="#step-six-rest-it-again" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Remember how I said gluten is really active when you press it? Well, you just
made it even more active. You also probably incorporated some small air bubbles.
So cover the sheets of dough with plastic and rest them for 30 minutes. This
will make it easier to roll and cut later on. For those who have made pasta
before, this should be familiar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-seven-roll-and-cut">
<h2>Step Seven: Roll and Cut<a class="headerlink" href="#step-seven-roll-and-cut" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Take your sheets, and starting with the largest setting, roll out setting by
setting to your desired thickness. Dust the sheets with cornstarch or potato
starch as needed, and then, when the dough is to your thickness liking, cut
lengthwise into noodles. I use a noodle cutter attachment, but you can also cut
by hand if you like that rustic flair.</p>
<p>Once the noodles are cut, you can do one of two things before storing:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Ball ‘em up into portions, you’re done!</p></li>
<li><p>Knead the noodles into one another. This technique is called “temomi”, or
hand pressing, and creates an irregular, wavy texture. I like to dust the
noodles with cornstarch, knead them together into a ball, and then detangle
them. You can also press the noodles repeatedly into the surface of your
workspace for a similar effect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some shops will do the kneading right before cooking. I can only hypothesize
that the kneading immediately before cooking causes the gluten to become active,
resulting in more rigidity and slower cook time when the noodle is finally
cooked. When kneading right after cutting, but not before usage, the method is
primarily to change the appearance of the noodle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-eight-mature-noodles">
<h2>Step Eight: Mature Noodles<a class="headerlink" href="#step-eight-mature-noodles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ok, so you have beautiful, cut, perfect noodles. Time to eat?</p>
<p>Not so fast! These noodles need time! Sensing a pattern here?</p>
<p>Maturation is the final phase of ramen noodle making, and it’s extremely helpful
for developing ramen. In this final resting phase, the noodles… sit around. And
as a result, some final effects on the dough occur:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Final degassing. Any residual air trapped in the dough will eventually leave.
This is where nice noodles become glossy, translucent, and ultra chewy.</p></li>
<li><p>Hydration redistribution: residual water in the dough evaporates (you might
notice some minor condensation in the container over time). This results in a
more consistent product.</p></li>
<li><p>Enzymatic activity occurs. Enzymes in the flour get to work, developing
flavor in the dough, and snipping proteins, which result in a more robust
mesh of gluten.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Different noodles need to mature for different amounts of time. Generally
though, the more water you have in the dough, the longer the noodles should
mature. A good starting point is at least 24 hours for any noodle, but
experiment as you get comfortable with noodle making.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers will mature their final cut noodles at room temperature,
which rapidly improves the quality of the starch network. In the fridge, the
starch gel is much firmer than at room temperature, so the starch gel takes
longer to effectively collapse and become dense when cold. Essentially, the room
temperature approach is a rapid, faster method. It is a quintessential technique
of Sapporo style noodles. However, you need to be careful; at room temperature,
there’s a possibility for pathogen growth. Noodles with an appropriate level of
alkalinity, or preservatives like alcohol or sorbitol, can withstand room
temperature better.</p>
<p>While refrigerated, noodles keep for several weeks. For long term storage,
noodles can be kept in the freezer for easily 6 months with no reduction in
quality.</p>
