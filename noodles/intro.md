# Noodles

Noodles' creation, at its core, is a combination of art and science. But that
science part can be easily overlooked. Most cookbooks oversimplify the
complexity of creating noodles. They often avoid the nuance of different noodle
styles and how different noodles pair with different broths. In this chapter,
I'll cover all of those aspects, from general noodle rules of thumb to the
science and techniques behind making excellent ramen noodles at home. 

Before I begin, I should note: noodles are the most labor-intensive part of
ramen making for the home cook. Ramen was designed during a time when noodles
were manufactured by machines; it doesn't have a history of hand-making like
soba or udon. The dough has a very low water content compared to other doughs
you might work with at home, making it challenging to wrangle. As a result, most
modern ramen noodles are still machine made. Even the majority of shops in Japan
outsource noodle production.

For a home cook, they suck to make. You will swear, sweat, and ache the first
time you make them. So for beginners or novice ramen cooks, I highly recommend
skipping noodle-making until you feel comfortable with the other components of
ramen. Many noodle brands exist; go to your local Asian grocery store and look
in the freezer section. I particularly like Sun Noodle (they make a wide variety
of noodle styles), but whichever noodle you buy, it will save you a ton of time.
Disclaimer aside, if you're still interested in noodle making, read on.
