# Mushroom Shoyu Tare

For a vegan option, this variant is nice. The mushrooms contain guanylate, which
helps improve the sensation of umami on the palate. A small addition of tamari
helps round out the richness of the mushroom flavor, but is otherwise optional. 

## Ingredients

* 450 g soy sauce
* 5 g tamari (optional) 
* 50 g mirin
* 20 g dried mushrooms (such as shiitake, morel, porcini. I like to use a
  combination)
* 15 g kombu
* 15 g brown sugar

## Steps

1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, dried mushrooms, and kombu in a sealed
   container.

2. Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.

3. When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F, hold for 10 minutes. 

4. Remove the kombu and discard.

5. Bring the contents to a boil.

6. Add the sugar, whisking to dissolve.

7. Strain out the mushrooms, reserve the tare as needed. Hold in the fridge for
   up to 6 months.

Add 35 mL of tare per 350 mL soup.
