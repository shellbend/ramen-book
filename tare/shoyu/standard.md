# Standard Shoyu Tare

This is an all-purpose shoyu tare. Great for light chicken broths, it also works
well to make shoyu tonkotsu or other shoyu-forward recipes. Make it, keep it in
the fridge for months, and use it when you feel like having a clean bowl. 

## Ingredients

* 450 g soy sauce
* 15 g kombu
* 50 g mirin
* 40 g sake
* 15 g niboshi
* 15 g katsuobushi
* 30 g brown sugar

## Steps

1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, kombu, niboshi, and sake in a sealed container.

2. Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.

3. When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F and hold for 10 minutes. 

4. Remove the kombu and discard.

5. Bring to 82 °C/180 °F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes. 

6. Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82 °C/180 °F for 5 more minutes. 

7. Add the sugar, whisking to dissolve.

8. Strain the tare, and reserve the tare as needed and keep refrigerated. This
   stores in the fridge for up to 6 months.
