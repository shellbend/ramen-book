# Smoked Shoyu Tare
 
I developed this recipe as part of a popup with Flat and Point. I don't expect
anyone to make it, but I'm documenting it here in the off chance you have a
smoker and want to give it a shot. 

## Ingredients

* 300 g smoked soy sauce (add soy sauce to a pan, place in a smoker at 110째C/225
  째F, and smoke until reduced by half) 
* 250 g smoked mushroom liquid (smoke mushrooms in a deep pan at 110 째C/225 째F,
  until withered) 
* 50 g mirin
* 20 g brown sugar
* 15 g salt
* 20 g msg

## Steps

1. Combine the above ingredients in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil to
   dissolve the salt and sugar.

2. Once fully dissolved, allow tare to cool, then use it as needed.

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.
