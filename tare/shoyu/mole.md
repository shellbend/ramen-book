# Mole Shoyu Tare

This is a recipe I played with on and off before my first popup at Ramen Lab.
The team I worked with wanted something unique in addition to spicy. It has
moderate heat, but complex chili flavors. It works excellently with chicken
broth, or in tsukemen variants, but it's a weird one for sure. The ingredient
list may seem daunting but the process overall is quite simple. 

## Ingredients

* 70 g onion, pureed in a food processor or grated finely (around ¼ an onion)
* 28 g mulato chilis, seeded (around 2 chilis)
* 16 g ancho chilis, seeded (around 2 chilis)
* 22 g guajillo chilis, seeded (around 2 chilis)
* 3 g dried Chinese chilis or whole togarashi
* 120 g water or chicken broth from ramen
* 6 g chipotle powder, or 1 canned chipotle 
* 2 g cinnamon
* 0.5 g ground clove 
* 1 g ground cumin
* 5 g instant coffee granules
* 0.5 g dried oregano (approx ½ tsp)
* 6 g cocoa powder
* 4 g MSG
* 0.5 g cayenne pepper (approx ½ tsp)
* 150 g soy sauce
* 30 g brown sugar
* 20 g tahini

## Steps

1. In a small saute pan, add the onion puree and cook with a small amount of oil
   over low heat, until golden brown, stirring occasionally to prevent burning,
   around 20--30 minutes. 

2. Remove the onion from the heat. 

3. In a separate large saute pan, toast the mulato, ancho, guajillo, and Chinese
   chilis over medium-high heat until fragrant, pliable, and starting to brown,
   around 3--5 minutes.

4. Cut the heat, and add the water (or broth if using), cover, and let steep for
   10--15 minutes, or until the chilis are soft and reconstituted. If your pan is
   hot, you might need to add more water.

5. To the jar of a blender, add the contents from the saucepans in steps 2 and 3
   with the remaining ingredients. 

6. Blend until the sauce has a uniform consistency. If the sauce is too thick,
   dilute with water as needed. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. 


Add 30g of tare per 350 mL soup, adding an additional 20 mL of soy sauce to the
bottom of the bowl.
