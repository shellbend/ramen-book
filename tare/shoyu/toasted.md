# Toasted Shoyu Tare

This is a variant on the Standard Shoyu Tare. For those who like those
caramelized, fish forward flavors, this is a good option, as the rapid heating
of the niboshi here amplifies their flavor in the final tare. 

## Ingredients

* 450 g soy sauce
* 15 g kombu
* Vegetable oil (15 mL or so) 
* 20 g niboshi
* 15 g katsuobushi
* 50 g mirin
* 40 g sake

## Steps

1. Combine the soy sauce and kombu into a sealed container.

2. Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.

3. When ready, heat a saucepan over medium heat. 

4. Add your niboshi and vegetable oil, toast for 30--45 seconds, or until
   fragrant and starting to brown.

5. Add your soy sauce and kombu to the pot with the niboshi.

6. Heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F, hold for 10 minutes. 

7. Remove the kombu and discard.

8. Bring 82 °C/180 °F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes. 

9. Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82 °C/180 °F for 5 more minutes. 

10. Strain and reserve liquid on the side.

11. In a new clean pot, add your mirin and sake. Bring to a boil, and simmer for
    5 minutes. 

12. Add this mixture to your mixture from step 9. You can store this in the
    fridge for up to 6 months. 

Add 35 mL of tare per 350 mL soup.
