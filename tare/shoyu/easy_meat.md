# Easy Meat Shoyu Tare (aka Jiro-Style Tare)

Jiro ramen uses a pretty simple tare, where they take some cut of pork that is
cooked in the broth, and soak it in a sauce that eventually turns into tare. The
meat becomes seasoned and can be used as chashu, and the sauce becomes the tare
that seasons the bowl. I love this approach, even for shoyu, although the tare
is a little sweet, so much that it isn't as applicable to other bowls. 

# Ingredients

* Chashu, cooked in broth until tender (see {ref}`Jiro Broth Recipe
  <jiro-style-tonkotsu-soup>` for examples) 
* 450 g soy
* 100 g mirin
* 15 g MSG
* 15 g brown sugar

# Steps

1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and MSG in a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
   then remove from the heat.

2. Place the chashu into the liquid, reserve in the fridge for 4--12 hours. 

3. Remove the chashu, use it for eating or other purposes. Store the tare in a
   sealed container for up to 2 months. 

Add 45 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.
