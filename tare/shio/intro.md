# Shio Tare

Shio, meaning salt, is a salt-based sauce, which is meant to be more about
amplifying the existing flavors of the soup than contributing other flavors.
Since the base soup is unseasoned, this tare acts more as a backdrop, adding
saltiness and complexity. It often contains a host of dried fish products and
blends of different salt. It also, oddly enough, can contain small traces of soy
sauce. Againâ€¦ what are the rules even in ramen?

Shio tare is also the most difficult tare to make, given its ingredients bill.
But there are alternatives. Much like the shoyu template, I find a bare-bones
idea (shown below) is helpful when thinking about designing your shio tare.

## Bare Bones Shio Tare 

This is a template for virtually all tares. It gives you a tare with umami and
salt because it uses salt and MSG, and nothing else. On its own it adds minimal
complexity, the goal is to highlight the qualities of the soup you've created.
But it also establishes a few principles I like to make ramen by, notably that
you can use approximately 10% salt in your tare, and 6% glutamic acid including
ingredients. All shio tares can be built around these ratios. 

### Ingredients

* 500 g water
* 50 g salt
* 33 g msg

### Steps

1. Combine the above ingredients in a saucepan, and heat to dissolve the tare.

2. Cover the saucepan and allow it to cool before storing indefinitely in the
   fridge. 

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.
