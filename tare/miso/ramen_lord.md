# Ramen_Lord's Miso Tare

After more than 8 years of tweaking and experimenting with miso tare, here's my
take. It's very miso forward. If you don't like your miso so forward in the
flavor of the final dish, you can cook the tare in a saucepan or wok for 5--10
minutes over medium heat. Doing so releases volatile compounds in the miso (of
which there are [many][] {cite}`kumazawa_identification_2013`). 

## Ingredients

* 140 g raw onion pureed in a food processor, or grated finely (around one half
  of an onion)
* 7 g garlic, grated (around 2 cloves)
* 6 g ginger, grated (around a 1-inch piece)
* 300 g white miso (I use Yamabuki Shinshu) 
* 180 g tezukuri or mugi miso (I use Yamabuki Tezukuri) 
* 80 g hatcho style miso
* 20 g mirin
* 30 g soy sauce
* 5 g sesame oil
* 14 g tahini or nerigoma
* 1 g black pepper (or around 20 grinds from a pepper mill)
* 2 g tobanjan (or Chinese doubanjiang) 
* pinch of white pepper
* pinch of togarashi or cayenne 

## Steps
 
1. Take 70 g of the raw onion puree, and add to a small pan. 
2. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, around 20--30
   minutes.
3. Remove from heat, place the cooked onion in a mixing bowl.
4. When the onion has cooled, add all remaining other ingredients. Use a whisk
   to combine. 
5. Place in the fridge in a covered container and allow the tare to mature for
   at least 24 hours to better develop the flavor and remove some of the
   harshness from the raw vegetables. The tare will keep for up to 12 months. 

Add 70 g of tare per 350 mL soup.
