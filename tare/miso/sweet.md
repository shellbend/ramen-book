# Sweet Miso Tare (For Akayu Style Bowls) 

The tare is a cooked miso tare, with a relatively low miso flavor as a result,
the cooking process sending off volatile flavor compounds. The goal here is to
cook out the alcohol, and most of the fruitiness of the miso. This is,
ironically, much easier to do at home than it is in bigger quantity. So, yay for
us home cooks! 

Since the miso is cooked, feel free to buy sub-par miso for this. We're not as
much interested in nuanced miso complexity (like we are with my ramen).

## Ingredients

* 125 g white miso
* 125 g red miso
* 25 g mirin
* 50 g sake
* 25 g soy sauce
* 10 g tahini
* 6 g salt
* 6 g MSG
* 15 ml vegetable oil
* Pinch Black pepper
* Pinch of Togarashi

## Steps
 
1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl. 
2. Add to a nonstick skillet, and cook, over medium low heat, until the smell of
   alcohol evaporates, and the paste turns thicker in texture, around 15--20
   minutes.
3. Allow to cool, then transfer to a container to store in the fridge. Reserve
   indefinitely in the fridge.

Add 60 g of tare per 300 mL soup.
