# Green Onions

I think green onions are the most important topping in ramen. Scallions add
sharpness, vegetal complexity, texture, and color contrast. In Japan, a similar
allium known as "Tokyo negi" is often swapped in, but the flavor and preparation
are similar enough that most home cooks can get away with using scallions.

You have a few options with how you prepare your green onions, most of which is
personal preference:

* **Ringlets**: slice the scallion into small rings, typically as thin as you can
  get them. The goal of this cut is to have the green onions be so thin that
  they give almost no texture to the bowl. You can use the green or the white or
  both for this application.

* **Oblong diamonds**: a more western technique, slicing the green onions at a
  45-degree angle gives the resulting shape a diamond-like appearance.

* **Threads**: you can also slice the green onion lengthwise. Cut the green
  onion into 3-inch pieces, rotate, and slide into threads. The layers of the
  green onion will help you achieve this, and it's easier with the white part of
  the green onion.

* **Fine dice**: After creating threads along the length of the onion, you can
  slice the green onion further into small dice. This looks nice when added with
  the tare, giving the surface of the soup a speckled appearance.

Since the onions are served raw, there's no recipe for their preparation, only
that you cut them how you'd like to eat them. It is of my humble opinion,
however, that scallions should be included on virtually every bowl. A bowl of
ramen without scallions feels incomplete, even with chashu, eggs, menma, or
anything else.
