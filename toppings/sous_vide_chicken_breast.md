# Sous Vide Chicken Breast

Unlike my opinions on sous vide pork, which often teeters back and forth
preference and dislike, sous vide is my preferred method when including chicken
breast. 

For one, chicken breast is probably the most misunderstood and disrespected meat
of all time. Widely available in supermarkets, most chicken breast is either too
dry or underseasoned. Many home cooks have avoided this cut entirely for fattier
dark meat pieces like thigh or drumsticks, and for good reason. They're usually
far easier to cook and often result in far more palatable dishes. 

Sous vide takes all of the needed measurement and process control away and fixes
the temperature, which is controlled by a computer. You can't overcook something
if you know exactly what temperature it's going to be. And sous vide hinges on
equilibrium cooking, that is, the heat of the surrounding water is equal to the
temperature you want the final product to be. So this is my preferred method for
chicken breasts. It is extremely versatile, feel free to add herbs, other
spices, or seasonings like soy sauce or mirin, to the bag. 

## Ingredients

* Chicken breast
* Salt to taste
* Ice water for shocking
* Pepper (optional)
* Other seasonings (optional) 

## Steps

1. Preheat a water bath to 63 째C/145 째F using a sous vide water circulator (or
   whichever temperature you prefer, to me 63 째C/145 째F is extremely supple,
   juicy, and tender). 

2. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, making sure to cover the
   breasts evenly.

3. Place the chicken breasts in a sturdy bag ideally one used for a vacuum
   sealer or a sealable bag.

4. Remove as much of the air from the bag as possible. Use either a vacuum
   sealer or the water in the immersion circulator to push out the air before
   sealing the bag.

5. Cook for 2 hours (or up to 4) to ensure pasteurization. 

6. Remove from the water bath, slice as desired. If not using immediately, chill
   the breasts quickly via an ice bath, and store in the fridge until needed.
