# Toppings

Toppings, like with many other components of ramen, depend on the goal of the
dish. Toppings can enhance the existing flavors in the dish or contrast with
them. They can provide textural contrast or can easily blend into the soup,
providing additional flavor notes. We can imagine that topics have a ton of
versatility if they can fit so many different characteristics. And because they
can be so diverse, there's plenty of room for innovation and experimentation. In
this chapter, we'll cover a handful of common toppings used in ramen, as well as
ingredients and steps to make them. 

But, still, there is *so* much variation in toppings. You can go an infinite
number of directions based on your taste. Much like with everything else in
ramen, there's a lot of room to explore, get creative, and make the bowl yours.
So this chapter will focus on some staples, mainly the proteins, or
technique-specific toppings that aren't obvious to the home cook.
