# Roasted Tomato

This method is blatantly stolen from the legendary [Ivan Orkin][orkin_ivan_2013]
{cite}`orkin_ivan_2013`, who used this topping to great effect in his shio ramen
in Japan. It's delicious, and a great alternative for an umami-laden ingredient.


## Ingredients

* Tomatoes (I like Roma tomatoes, but any tomato you like will work) 
* Salt
* Pepper
* Olive Oil

## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 121 °C/ 225 °F. 
2. Slice the tops and bottoms off of the tomato, then slice the tomato in half
   lengthwise (so that you have two round, fat disks of tomato). 
3. Place the tomato on a baking sheet, season with salt, pepper, and drizzle
   with olive oil. 
4. Roast the tomatoes until they are plush, withered, and have shrunk in size,
   around 2--3 hours.
