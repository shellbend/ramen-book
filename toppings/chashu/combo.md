# Combination Method: Braise then Roast

As I was writing this book, I wondered, why not combine some of the approaches
to get the ideal results for each? I love the deeply caramelized exterior of
roasted pork but hate how much you have to babysit it. And I love the melty
quality of a braised piece of meat but hated how it lacked true roasted flavor.
The term "chashu" is derived from Cantonese style BBQ pork after all. This
method, therefore, combines both approaches, to get succulent meat, and a
delicious, charred exterior. 

Since the pork sits out of the braising liquid while the oven preheats, the
surface is dry and slightly tacky from the sugar, so it caramelizes very
quickly. A quick blast in the oven is all it takes. 

## Ingredients
 
* Pork belly (I find this method is less successful with shoulder) 
* 60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) mirin
* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) soy sauce
* 250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
* 25 g (approx. 2 tbsp) brown sugar
* 60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) sake
* Three garlic cloves, smashed

## Steps

1. Add all ingredients to a saucepan large enough to hold the pork, but small
   enough to allow for the pork to be submerged.

2. Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the vessel. 

3. Continue to cook the pork at a simmer until tender, or the internal
   temperature registers above 95 째C/203 째F, around 90 minutes (though the
   thickness of your pork belly will increase this cooking time). When in doubt,
   probe the pork belly to make sure the texture is appropriate, it should be
   soft, yielding, and jiggly.  

4. Remove the pork and place it on a wire rack set in a baking sheet. Reserve
   the liquid in a container of your choice that will be big enough to hold the
   pork as well. 

5. Preheat your oven to 230 째C/450 째F. 

6. When the oven is heated, Place the pork in the oven and roast for 5--10
   minutes, or until the exterior of the pork is dark, rusted, and bubbling.  

7. Place the hot pork back into the braising liquid in the container. Allow to
   cool the room temperature, then let chill overnight in the fridge before
   slicing.
