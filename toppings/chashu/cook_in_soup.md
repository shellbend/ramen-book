# Cook in Soup 

Take your belly or shoulder, and toss it into your simmering/boiling broth. Tie
it, keep it loose, whatever you like, just put it in your broth when it begins
to bubble, and after you've skimmed any scum. 

Then, cook in the broth until tender, anywhere from 2--3 hours. Remove the pork
when you feel it is sufficiently cooked (for a melty piece of meat, I prefer
around 203 °F, though anything above 190 °F will be very tender), and place in
the {ref}`Easy Meat Shoyu Tare <easy-meat-shoyu-tare>`, and allow to soak in the
fridge for 2--4 hours. This seasons the pork, your tare, *and* adds porky goodness
to your soup. It's not complex, but some styles, like Jiro ramen, hinge on this
approach.
