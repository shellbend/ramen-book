# Standard Braise 

This is often how I make chashu. The pork is really tender, to the point that it
actually becomes difficult to pick up with chopsticks, so if you're into that
extremely luscious texture, this method is for you. You can mix things up by
adding green onion, ginger, garlic, or other aromatics to your braising liquid,
but I've always kept it simple. 

## Ingredients

* Pork belly or shoulder (weight is not important here)
* Salt to taste
* Pepper to taste
* 125 mL (½ cup) mirin
* 125 mL (½ cup) soy sauce
* 250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
* 12.5 g (approx. 1 tbsp) brown sugar
* 60 mL (approx. ¼ cup) sake
* Three garlic cloves, smashed

## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 110 °C/225 °F.

2. Heat a large, oven-safe vessel that you can sear in over medium heat. Cast
   iron or an enameled dutch oven works great here, but any oven-safe pot or pan
   will work.

3. Season the exterior of the pork with salt and pepper on all sides. 

4. Place the pork in the heated pan and sear on all sides until golden brown,
   around 4--5 minutes per side. 

5. Some fat will render as the pork cooks. With a paper towel, sop up residual
   fat. 

6. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mirin, soy sauce, water, and brown sugar.
   Stir to dissolve the brown sugar. Then add the garlic. At this stage, you
   could also add other aromatics like ginger, or green onion. 

7. Deglaze the pan with the sake, then add in the ingredients from step 6. 

8. Bring the liquid to a boil, then cover the vessel. 

9. Place the vessel into the oven, and braise, occasionally turning the pork
   every hour or so, until the pork is quite tender, and the internal
   temperature reaches around  93 °C/200 °F. 
   
10. Remove, allow to cool, then place in the fridge with the cooking liquid, and
    chill to allow for easy slicing.
