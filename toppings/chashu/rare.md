# "Rare" Chashu 

In the past 10 years, chashu has evolved to be more than simply cooked pork
shoulder. 

Techniques like sous vide have rapidly improved the capacity to cook and eat
pork products in unique and often otherwise impossible ways. Chefs in Japan have
used the technique of sous vide to cook pieces of pork until they are just
barely cooked, around 57 °C/135 °F or so, then chilling thoroughly before
slicing. Hence the name "rare" chashu. It's legit rare pork, taking on the color
of something like rare roast beef. 

I've found, admittedly, that this concept is pretty hard for most Americans to
get behind, especially with American pork. The texture is somewhere between
steak-like and ham, and the color is very pink, which some Americans would say
is undercooked. That doesn't mean it's unsafe though. The odds of getting
trichinosis, the main pathogen in undercooked pork, are [very low][cdc]
{cite}`cdc`. The CDC reports less than 20 cases yearly, in large part due to
extensive safety precautions taken by meat manufacturers, effectively
eliminating it as a safety measure. The USDA as a result has lowered the
required temperature of pork products to 63 °C/145 °F. But as, realistically you
can probably go lower, and to get rare chashu, a lower temperature is required. 

Texture-wise, it's a completely different product than the well-done pork I
described earlier. It needs to be thinly sliced to account for the lack of
collagen breakdown. And it can quickly go from pink to grey if it sits in the
hot soup for too long, as the pork effectively cooks further in the heat. Rare
chashu also often uses different cuts of pork than more traditional chashu.
Unlike well-done chashu, which uses belly or a standard shoulder roast, rare
chashu most often uses a specific cut of the shoulder typically called the
"coppa." In the world of BBQ, this cut is called "the tubes."  Other names
include the CT Butt, the top of the shoulder, or even the so-called "pork neck"
muscle. No matter the name, this is a section of the shoulder that runs the
furthest from the large bone you typically find in a pork shoulder and is
heavily marbled with fat in between circular, tube-shaped muscle groups. 

That's not to suggest that rare chashu must use the coppa. Practically, rare
chashu can be made from any cut of nicely marbled shoulder, but traditionally
the tubes are used to get the quintessential round look seen in shops. 

## Ingredients

* Pork coppa or pork shoulder
* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) mirin
* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) soy sauce
* 250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
* 13 g (1 tbsp) brown sugar
* 60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) sake
* Ice water for shocking

## Steps
 
1. (optional) Using butcher's twine, tie the pork into a round shape. 

2. Preheat a water bath to 57 °C/135 °F using a sous vide water circulator.

3. Sear the pork belly on all sides on high heat in a pan until golden brown,
   then place in a sturdy bag (ideally one used for a vacuum sealer). 

4. Deglaze the pan with the remaining ingredients, then reserve this liquid and
   allow it to cool.

5. When the liquid has cooled, add it to the bag with the pork. 

6. Remove as much of the air from the bag as possible. Use either a vacuum
   sealer or the water in the immersion circulator to push out the air before
   sealing the bag.

7. Cook the pork belly for 2--3 hours. 

8. Remove the meat from the bath, and shock in ice water to chill quickly.
   Reserve in the fridge until needed, then slice as desired.
