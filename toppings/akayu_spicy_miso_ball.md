# Akayu Spicy Miso Ball

This is a recipe derived from a topping created by a shop called Ryushanhai in
the Yamagata prefecture of Japan in 1960. It's meant to top Akayu style bowls of
ramen, but can be used in a host of other applications, especially if you're a
glutton for spice. I can't say that this will be 100% in line with the style,
but it has noticeable heat, and is fun to slowly stir into the soup as you
consume it. Don't worry too much about the quality of the miso you use here,
it's mostly for body and salt, and acts as a backdrop to the primary flavors of
garlic and spice. 

## Ingredients

* 80 g garlic
* 40 g Thai Bird Chilis (other fresh red chilis would also work here)
* 5 g Vegetable oil
* Optional: 3 g Fish Powder
* 60 g White Miso
* 60 g brown miso
* 10 g fine Korean Chili powder (add more for more heat)

## Steps
 
1. Combine the garlic and chilis in the bowl of a food processor. Process until
   a fine paste.

2. Add the paste to a skillet with the oil, and cook over medium heat, until the
   garlic's pungency has subsided considerably, and the vegetables have released
   most of their moisture, around 5 minutes.

3. Add the fish powder if using, bloom it with the chili and garlic mixture over
   medium heat, around 1 minute. 
   
4. Combine the garlic/chili paste with the remaining ingredients. 

Use around 30--40 g per bowl (but personal preference rules here)
