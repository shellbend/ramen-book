# Basic Paitan Method

The only major difference between the paitan and the chintan method is the rate
of boil needed to emulsify the fat. And even this isn't necessary if you'd like
to use a blender, the churning action of the rapid boil isn't required. 

## Ingredients

* Animal parts (such as chicken backs, pork neck bones, femurs, or other bones
  of your liking)
* An equal part by weight of water. (Add more water for thinner result) 
* Aromatic vegetables and ingredients for complexity

## Steps

1. Submerge the animal parts with water. If using pork bones, you may wish to
   soak the bones overnight to remove some of the myoglobin. 

2. Heat over high heat until the pot begins to boil.

3. Skim the scum that rises to the top. If using pork bones, you may opt to
   discard the water and start again with fresh water, bringing up to a boil.

4. Continue to boil over medium/medium-high heat for the recommended time based
   on ingredients. *Add water to maintain sufficient coverage of the bones* (as
   evaporation occurs as the bones cook). 

5. In the last hour, add aromatics, and continue to boil.

6. You may optionally mash the contents of the pot to promote emulsification and
   full extraction.

7. Strain the soup and reserve or chill thoroughly. If not fully emulsified,
   blend the desired amount of fat into soup until the emulsion level desired is
   achieved. 

Virtually all paitans in this book will follow this approach. The last step, in
particular, is noteworthy because it is unorthodox, and typically only conducted
in a home setting. You could theoretically emulsify all of the soup with all the
fat, resulting in something not unlike milk or cream. You may not want this
level of emulsification. Ultimately you as the cook decide how far you'd like
the emulsion to go. 

Below are some specific recipes I use regularly.
