# Roasted Bone Tonkotsu Soup

In my desire to stop having to skim and manage scum and funk in tonkotsu, I
opted to try roasting all of the bones in the ingredient bill. The resulting
broth is slightly darker, but with a blend, it turns quite creamy regardless.

## Ingredients

* 2 kg/4.4 lb neck bones
* 2 kg/4.4 lb femurs, split to expose the marrow
* 6 L water
* optional aromatics: 1 onion, halved, 10 peeled garlic cloves, 1 2-inch piece
  of ginger, peeled and sliced
 
## Steps
 
1. Preheat the oven to 230 °C/450 °F

2. When heated, place the bones on a sheet tray, and roast for 45 minutes to an
   hour, turning the bones halfway, until they look brown and caramelized. 

3. Add the bones to a pot with water to cover. You may opt to also deglaze the
   roasting tray with more water, and add this water to the pot. 

4. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.

5. If using, add aromatics to the broth in the last hour.

6. Strain the soup.

7. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30
   seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid
   splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can
   also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won't be
   as strong. 

8. Reserve the soup as needed.
