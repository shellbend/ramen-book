# Tonkotsu Soup

Tonkotsu is a paitan of pork bones. This is the basic tonkotsu approach that
most restaurants essentially use. You may find in your research that some
restaurants add in new bones midway through cooking, or use different bones like
heads or ribs, but overall, the method is effectively the same: cook bones to
death, and emulsify everything. 

## Ingredients

* 2 kg/4.4 lb neck bones
* 2 kg/4.4 lb femurs, split to expose the marrow
* 6 L water
* optional (to add additional fat): 0.5 kg/1.1 lb fatback
* optional aromatics: 1 onion, halved, and 10 peeled garlic cloves
 
## Steps
 
1. The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones
   and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware
   container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting tonkotsu
   is whiter in appearance).

2. When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water.
   Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the
   top of the pot. Do this for 15--20 minutes, or until little scum is rising.
   The scum goes through several phases here, you'll know when the scum is
   pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white tonkotsu, don't
   skip it, and don't end it prematurely.

3. Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid.

4. Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty
   looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices. 

5. Add your now clean bones to a pot.

6. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.

7. If using, add aromatics to the broth in the last hour.

8. Strain the soup.

9. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30
   seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid
   splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can
   also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won't be
   as strong. 

10. Reserve the soup as needed.
