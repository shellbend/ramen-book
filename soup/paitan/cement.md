# "Cement" Ramen

Despite the name, this style specifically refers to the color of the soup, which
is a greyish/greenish hue. The color comes from blending in whole niboshi and
niboshi powder before straining, a slightly unorthodox but effective technique
for adding additional flavors. This is a popular but admittedly polarizing
style, heavy on fish notes, and can be daunting. But the soup is a fish lover's
delight. The blended fish helps to stabilize the emulsion. 

## Ingredients

* 2 kg / 4.4 lb pork femurs, split to expose their marrow
* 4 L water
* 1 onion, halved
* 1 2-in piece of ginger, peeled and sliced into thin coins
* 8 cloves of garlic
* 300 g niboshi, medium-sized
* 20 g kombu
* 35 g niboshi, small sized

## Steps

1. Combine medium-sized niboshi and kombu, cover with 2 L water, place in the
   fridge to soak overnight (This overnight soak is to help save time, over
   traditional dashi. You can also follow the dashi method shown here). 

2. Soak pork bones in water overnight.

3. Take soaked pork bones, discard soaking water, and add to new water in a pot.
   Bring to high heat and blanch to remove scum, around 5--10 minutes at a
   rolling boil.

4. Strain, discard blanching liquid. Cover with 4 L of new water. Boil for 18
   hours. 

5. After 18 hours, add aromatics and boil for 1 hour.

6. Strain. You should have around 2--3 L.

7. Add steeped niboshi and kombu mix to strained soup. Bring to a boil. At 80
   °C/176 °F, discard kombu.

8. Reduce heat to lowest on the stove, simmer the niboshi for 1 hour.

9. Strain soup, reserving niboshi.

10. In a blender, blend the small niboshi to form a powder. 

11. Add reserved niboshi from step 9 to the powder-filled blender jar, and
    enough soup to cover (including as much un-emulsified fat as possible).
    Blend on high until grey/green slurry is formed. The niboshi should be quite
    soft at this stage.

12. Add slurry back to the soup, mix to incorporate.

13. Strain one more time to remove the residual pulp, pressing on pulp to
    achieve full extraction.

14. Reserve soup until needed.
