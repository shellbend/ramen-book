# Yamagata Style "Akayu" Chintan

This recipe is in fact similar to the Eifukucho Taishoken recipe, in that the
shop comes from the early '60s. You'll notice similarities in method across
older shops, that they use a higher ratio of water to bones, and heavily dump in
fish products to provide umami. This soup is specifically meant to be paired
with other Akayu recipes (please see the appendix for details), the aromatics
pair nicely with a miso tare. 

## Ingredients

* 1.5 kg/3.4 lbs femur bones
* 3 L water
* Half a carrot
* One inch slice of a cabbage head
* 8 cloves Garlic
* One bunch of green onions
* 30 grams Niboshi
* 15 g Kombu
* 15 g Katsuobushi

## Steps

1. Add the pork bones to a stockpot, cover with water.

2. Bring up to a boil over high heat. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to
   the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20
   minutes.

3. Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (around 88
   °C/190 °F), 7 hours.

4. In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour at
   below simmer.

5. Strain the soup and reserve until needed.
