# "Doubutsu Kei" Style Chintan

This recipe combines chicken and pork products to produce a more round amino
acid profile. Lighter in body, this soup is excellent in Miso, it's also good
with shoyu applications. I like to blanch the pork neck bones to remove some of
the myoglobin and preserve clarity, but this is optional. 

Should you desire, you can also use all chicken backs, or all pork bones, for
this recipe. 

## Ingredients

* 2 kg/4.4 lb pork neck bones
* 2 kg/4.4 lb chicken backs
* 6 L water
* 1 onion, peeled and halved 
* 10 cloves garlic, peeled.
* 1 2-inch piece of ginger

## Steps

1. Blanch the pork neck bones briefly by covering them with cold water in a pot,
   bringing them to a boil, and cooking for 15--20 minutes, or until the scum
   subsides. Strain the bones and reserve. 

2. Add neck bones and chicken backs to new water in a stockpot, bring to a
   simmer, and skim any scum that rises, for around 5--10 minutes. 

3. Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around  88 °C/190 °F), hold for 7
   hours (additional time to account for the pork bones). 

4. Add your onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook for an additional hour. 

5. Strain the soup and hold until needed.
