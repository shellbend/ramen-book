# All-Purpose Chintan

This recipe is very similar to the doubutsu kei soup mentioned before, but
excludes the ginger and pork, making this an overarchingly all-purpose soup,
even in non-ramen applications. 

## Ingredients

* 4 kg/8.8 lb chicken backs
* 6 L water
* 1 onion, peeled and halved
* 10 cloves garlic, peeled.

## Steps

1. Add neck bones and chicken backs to freshwater in a stockpot, bring to a
   simmer, and skim any scum that rises, for around 5--10 minutes. 

2. Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around  88 °C/190 °F), hold for 5
   hours

3. Add your onion and garlic. Cook for an additional hour. 

4. Strain the soup and hold it until needed.
