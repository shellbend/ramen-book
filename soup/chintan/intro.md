# Basic Chintan Method

## Ingredients

* Animal parts (such as chicken backs, pork neck bones, femurs, or other bones
  of your liking)

* Some amount of water (starting at equal parts, and going up to two parts, by
  weight, depending on the result and amount of connective-tissue laden
  ingredients). 

* Aromatic vegetables and ingredients for complexity

## Steps

1. Submerge the animal parts with water.

2. Heat over high heat until the pot begins to boil.

3. Skim the scum that rises to the top.

4. Reduce the heat to below sub-simmer (around 88 °C/190 °F) to preserve
   clarity.

5. Cook for the recommended time based on ingredients.

6. In the last hour, add the aromatics.

7. Strain the soup.

From this framework, you can make a host of different soups. Want a beef soup
with caramelized onions? Cook the beef bones for 8 hours, then toss in those
onions at the last hour. Want a super fishy, really rich, but clear chicken
soup? Cook the chicken parts, being sure to include some feet, for 6 hours,
adding in dashi elements like bushi products or niboshi, at the last hour. 

Below are some common recipes I use for chintan, depending on need.
