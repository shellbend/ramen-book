# Clam Dashi 

Clam in ramen is becoming more popular and this is a simple soup that can be
combined with others to create complexity. This dashi is clam forward,
containing only 3 ingredients, but some additional steps are needed to treat the
clams appropriately. This dashi can also have dashi elements like katsuobushi or
niboshi steeped in it after it is complete, should you choose to do so. If you'd
like to use the clams for eating after, you'll need to remove the grit from them
first (see the first steps of this recipe).

## Ingredients

* 1 L cold water
* 20 g sake
* 500 g clams (manila or cherrystone) 

## Steps

1. To remove the grit from the clams, place them in cold water and allow them to
   sit undisturbed for one hour.

2. Wash the clams and scrub their exteriors to remove any residual dirt on the
   outside.

3. Combine 1 L cold water, sake, and cleaned clams in a pot. 

4. Heat over high heat until reaching a simmer.

5. Cook the clams at a simmer for 10--15 minutes, or until the shells have opened
   and the clams are completely cooked.  

6. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed. You can then
   harvest the meat for alternative purposes. 

Much like the previous dashi, this only keeps for a few days in the fridge
should you choose to make it in advance.
