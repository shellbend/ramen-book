# Basic Dashi

This is an all-purpose dashi. If you're not sure where to start, this is a safe bet. It's simple but versatile.

Some variants of dashi also suggest an overnight soak before cooking can increase the amount of flavor extracted. To do this, simply combine the kombu (and niboshi or shiitake, if using) and water, and place in the fridge for 12--24 hours before cooking. Then proceed with step 2.

## Ingredients

* 1 L cold water
* 10 g kombu
* 25 g katsuobushi (or replace with niboshi, or shiitake, as desired) 

## Steps

1. Add the cold water and kombu to a pot (if using niboshi or shiitake, add with
   the kombu). 

2. Heat over medium-low heat until just below simmer, around 80 Â°C.

3. Turn off the heat and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.

4. Remove the kombu, add the katsuobushi (if using). 

5. Bring up to a simmer, then turn off the heat again, cover, and allow to steep
   until flavored to your liking, anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.

6. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed.

Dashi degrades quickly in flavor, so it only keeps for a few days in the fridge
if you decide to make it in advance. Luckily, it's relatively simple to put
together.
