# Chicken and Scallion Oil

This aroma oil is really nice for ramen bowls that are light in their richness. 

## Ingredients

* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) rendered chicken fat
* One bunch of scallion whites, trimmed of their ends and cut into 2-inch pieces
* 4 garlic cloves

## Steps

1. In a small saucepan, add the oil, scallions, and garlic cloves. 

2. Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
   scallions take on a light golden hue and smell fragrant, around 15 minutes. 

3. Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot, and allow it to cool. 

4. Strain and transfer to a container. If not used immediately, store in the
   fridge.
