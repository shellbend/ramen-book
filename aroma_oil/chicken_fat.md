# Chicken Fat 

Many of the recipes here will call for some sort of animal fat as the aroma oil.
Chicken fat, sometimes called, "schmaltz" is made from the skin most frequently.
It's surprisingly easy to make, and the resultant cooked chicken skins are a
tasty snack. 

## Ingredients
 
* Chicken skin
* 15--30 g water

## Steps
 
1. Add the skin and the water to a pan and heat, over medium heat. The water
   reduces the temperature of the cooking, which will render fat but prohibit
   browning, resulting in a cleaner tasting fat. You can omit it if you'd like
   the additional flavor browning provides.

2. Continue to cook until the skins have taken on a golden brown color and have
   rendered out their fat, approximately 45 minutes.
   
3. Strain and reserve the crispy skins as desired. If not using the oil
   immediately, keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. 

You can also use the fat that renders out of any chicken skin used while making
soup. This comes with the additional benefit of the skin contributing some of
its connective tissue (and therefore collagen) to the soup, enriching it with
gelatin. The negative of this approach is that the soup's oil soluble aromatics
will flavor this final fat, which you may or may not want.
