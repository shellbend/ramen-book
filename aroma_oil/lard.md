# Lard 

Lard is available at most grocery stores. However, should you desire, you can
also render pork fat to make lard at home. I find that purchasing even poor
quality lard is sufficient for most purposes since we sort of want that
piggy-flavor in most applications. But you do you. 

## Ingredients
 
* 2 lb backfat (or other fat-laden pork parts) 
* 15--30 g water

## Steps
 
1. Preheat an oven to 121 °C/250 °F.

2. Add fatback and water to an oven-safe pan.

3. Cook in the oven for 2--3 hours, or until the fatback has turned golden brown
   and rendered fully. 

4. Strain and reserve the fat as needed. If not using immediately, keep in the
   fridge for up to 6 months.
