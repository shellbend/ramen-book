# Negi Niboshi Oil

This is awesome on bowls with shoyu tares, or soups with fish-forward
characteristics like the {ref}`"Cement" ramen <cement-ramen>` soup. 

## Ingredients

* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) rendered chicken fat
* 5 whole scallions, trimmed of ends and cut into 2-inch pieces
* 10 medium-sized niboshi. 

## Steps

1. In a small saucepan, add the oil, scallions, and niboshi.

2. Heat over medium to medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
   scallions and niboshi take on a light golden hue, and smell fragrant, around
   15 minutes. 

3. Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot and allow to cool. 

4. Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the
   fridge for up to 6 months.
