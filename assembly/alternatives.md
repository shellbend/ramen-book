# Assembly Alternatives 

The basic approach to assembly applies to most bowls of ramen bowls. But it's
not the only method, as chefs inherently deviate to develop their approaches and
techniques when putting their stamp on the dish. Below are some methods that
have evolved over the last 100 years of the dish.

## Sapporo Miso Wok Method 

In the north of Japan, in Hokkaido, an emergence of wok cooking via Chinese
restaurants resulted in several ramen styles that incorporate woks as part of
the assembly of the ramen. This is particularly true for miso ramen, whose
origins specifically include the wok as part of the assembly, but even shoyu
ramen in the north can include wok cooking to some capacity. It's important to
understand the difference in assembly. 

Unlike in the standard ramen approach, the wok method follows the following
flow: 

1. The bowl is heated.
2. Noodles are cooked.
3. Aromatics are sauteed in fat in a wok (can be aroma oil or pure fat). 
4. Soup and tare are added to the wok. If the tare is added first, it can be
   charred, or cooked briefly, on the wok surface. If the soup is added first,
   the tare is added after and whisked in.
5. The soup and tare mixture is then poured into the bowl. In some instances,
   the noodles have finished cooking and go into the bowl, first, in other
   instances, the noodles are added after the soup. 
6. Aromatics are piled over the noodles, and final garnishes are applied.

Most miso ramen in Hokkaido is created this way. But the treatment of the tare
itself varies from shop to shop. Some commit to charring the tare, others keep
it mostly raw up until the very end. But the wok flavor is an integral component
of a true to style bowl of Sapporo ramen. 

## 69'N'Roll One And Multiple-Tare Approach

As part of the new wave of ramen in Tokyo, which focused on refining the
ingredient bill to only use top tier ingredients and to strip away excess, the
shop 69'N'Roll One is credited with a technique where a small dropper of
extremely potent, expensive soy sauce is added in addition to the tare to the
bottom of the bowl. 

This creates a new style of ramen where the tare is broken into components,
rather than being one cohesive sauce. Some newer shops now experiment with
multiple tares, arguing that different ingredients extract better in different
applications. As I've mentioned before, I disagree with this concept, as there's
very little evidence to suggest that extraction is impacted by these mediums,
but it's worth noting that the style does exist.

(tsukemen-approach)=
## Tsukemen

Tsukemen is distinct in that the soup and noodles are served separately, where
the customer is expected to dip the noodles into the soup before slurping them
up. Often the noodles are served cold, and the soup hot, providing temperature
contrast. The cold noodles, due to their preparation, also have an intensely
dense starch gel, providing substantial chew and gloss that is often
unachievable in standard ramen applications. 

Assembly is very similar to the standard approach, except that the noodles are
plated on the side. They may be shocked in cold water to stop the cooking or
served hot. 

## Aburasoba/Mazesoba/Mazemen

There are a host of different names for these approaches, but they all share the
same general framework in that they are essentially soup free. They share some
resemblance to pasta, with a dressing or sauce coating the noodle. 

Most of these styles work on a basic framework where: 

1. The sauce is placed in the bottom of the bowl.
2. Cooked noodles are added on top.
3. Garnishes are applied.
4. The customer is asked to mix the ingredients.

Virtually any ramen method can be turned into abura soba simply by excluding the
soup and adding the aroma oil and tare to the bottom of the bowl.
