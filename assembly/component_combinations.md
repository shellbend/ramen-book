# Component Combination Suggestions

As is the case with most ramen making, you'll need to combine tare, oils, soup,
and noodles to make a cohesive bowl. Below are suggestions based on the way
these recipes were designed, but they are by no means required combinations. See
what works for you, and adjust as necessary.

You may notice that the liquids in many of these methods are in volume, rather
than in mass measurements. This is primarily because volumetric measurement here
is often very fast (1 tbsp is 15 mL, 300 mL is 10 oz, etc.), and asking a
recipient to try and weigh out tare per bowl is an arduous affair in my opinion.
Volume, therefore, does make this easier. But of course, these are just
suggestions, your mileage may vary. 

In an ideal setting, getting specific ladles for these quantities will help
considerably. But a set of measuring spoons and cups will work fine. 

## Shoyu Ramen

* 300 mL {ref}`tokyo-style-chintan`
* 30 mL {ref}`standard-shoyu-tare`
* 20 mL {ref}`negi-niboshi-oil`
* 135 g {ref}`tokyo-style-noodle`

## New Wave Shoyu Ramen

* 350 mL {ref}`new-wave-chicken-chintan`
* 35 mL {ref}`new-wave-shoyu-tare`
* A few drops of tamari, optional
* 30 mL {ref}`chicken-fat` (half at the bottom of the bowl, half after noodles) 
* 130 g {ref}`new-wave-tokyo-noodle`

## Miso Ramen

* 350 mL {ref}`doubutsu-kei-chintan`
* 80 g {ref}`ramen-lords-miso-tare`
* 30 mL {ref}`ginger-and-onion-pork-lard`
* 140 g {ref}`sapporo-noodle`

Use the {ref}`standard-bowl-assembly` approach or the
{ref}`sapporo-miso-wok-method`.
 
## Shio Ramen

* 350 mL {ref}`all-purpose-chintan`
* 30 mL {ref}`white-wine-chicken-shio-tare` Tare
* 15 mL {ref}`all-purpose-scallion-oil`
* 135 g {ref}`tokyo-style-noodle`

## Akayu Ramen

* 300 mL {ref}`yamagata-style-chintan` Soup
* 50 g {ref}`sweet-miso-tare`
* 20 mL {ref}`lard`
* 40 g {ref}`akayu-spicy-miso-ball`
* 180 g {ref}`akayu-style-noodle`

## Tonkotsu

* 300 mL {ref}`tonkotsu-soup`
* 30 mL {ref}`bare-bones-shio-tare` or {ref}`lighter-shoyu-tare` (to preserve
  color, you can also use any shoyu tare if a darker color is preferred) 
* 15 mL {ref}`all-purpose-scallion-oil`
* 130 g {ref}`makeshift-hakata-style-noodle`

## Tantanmen

* 350 mL {ref}`all-purpose-chintan`
* One serving of {ref}`tantanmen-tare`
* 15 mL {ref}`chili-oil`
* 130 g {ref}`makeshift-hakata-style-noodle` or 140 g {ref}`tokyo-style-noodle`
* {ref}`spice-blend`, as desired for heat (start with 1 tsp, increase as
  desired) 

Since the tare in this is thick, it's sometimes helpful to whisk the tare and
the soup in the bowl to incorporate fully. 

## Chicken Paitan

* 300 mL {ref}`chicken-paitan-soup` Soup
* 30 mL {ref}`lighter-shoyu-tare` or {ref}`soy-shio-blend-tare`
* 15 mL {ref}`chicken-and-scallion-oil`, or {ref}`chicken-fat` (you can also use
  both) 
* 130 g {ref}`makeshift-hakata-style-noodle`

## Tonkotsu Gyokai Tsukemen

Please note the slightly lower volume of soup and the slightly higher relative
salinity, both of which are required for tsukemen to work.

* 250 mL {ref}`tsukemen-thick-soup`
* 30 mL {ref}`toasted-shoyu-tare`
* 10 mL (approx. 2 tsp) gyofun
* A few grinds of black pepper
* 200 g (or more) {ref}`thick-tsukemen-noodle`

Follow the {ref}`tsukemen-approach` approach, ensuring the noodles are shocked
thoroughly before assembling the soup.
