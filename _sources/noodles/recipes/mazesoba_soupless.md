# Mazesoba / Soupless Ramen Noodle

Mazesoba noodles, or noodles used for dishes that don't contain soup, can
contain a variety of different approaches. But the broad theory of them is that
they actually need less structural integrity, because they don't sit in soup. We
supplement this in this recipe by borrowing from Italian pasta ideas, namely,
using a lower protein flour, and an increased egg content. All purpose flour is
suitable here because the egg provides more structure than in a standard ramen
dough, and makes the dough relatively easier to work with. Using egg yolk as
part of the ingredients further tenderizes the dough, as fat prohibits some
gluten formation, making this dough even easier to work with. And since the egg
content is high here, the noodles are resilient in cooking, the egg white
helping reduce overcooking potential. 

## Ingredients (per portion)
 
* 100 g All Purpose flour
* 14 g whole fresh egg (or around 1 egg for every 300 g flour)
* 24 g water

```{note}
Total hydration including fresh egg is around 36%. If using powdered egg, use
36 g water, and 3 g egg powder
```

* 1 g salt

* 1 g baked soda, or powdered kansui (if using powdered kansui, use 0.8 g sodium
  carbonate, and 0.2 g potassium carbonate)

* optional: pinch of riboflavin (a literal pinch, less than 0.01 gram is all
  that's required). 

   * The egg yolk from the whole egg will provide some amount of color, but not
     as much as in true egg-pastas, so some dye helps. 


## Steps
 
1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water (and riboflavin if using), dissolve
   completely. If using both sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them
   one at a time. Go slowly, stir constantly until clear. This will take a
   while, but eventually, the contents will dissolve. You can make the solution
   several days before to get a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight
   container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour. Turn the mixer
   to "stir" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix. 

3. While running the mixer on stir, add two-thirds of your water mixture slowly,
   in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 3
   minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for another
   minute, until small clumps begin to form.

5. Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let
   this rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Don't skip this.

6. Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going
   through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and
   fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet
   it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and
   not ragged. 

7. After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30 minutes.

8. Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired
   thickness, using potato or cornstarch as you go to prevent sticking. 

9. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. 2 mm by 2 mm is standard for
   these, though you can go as thick as you'd like here. 

10. Bundle the noodles into 180 g portions and place them in a sealable bag. Put
    the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day. These noodles
    will oxidize and darken in appearance considerably if left in the fridge for
    more than 2--3 days, so for long term storage, freezing is recommended.
