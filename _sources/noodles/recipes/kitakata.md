# Kitakata Style Noodle 

This style of ramen is meant to be put together extremely quickly, with noodles
being cooked almost as soon as they're cut. As a result, the hydration is high,
and the kansui amount is high, while also being primarily sodium, allowing for
the dough to be noticeably extensible. Additional tapioca is used to help
provide structure in the event you want to cook the noodles immediately. 

## Ingredients (per portion)
 
* 95 g King Arthur all purpose flour
* 5 g Tapioca starch
* 45 g water
* 1 g salt
* 1.9 g baked soda

## Steps

1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water, dissolve completely. If using both
   sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them one at a time. Go slowly,
   stir constantly until clear. This will take a while, but eventually, the
   contents will dissolve. You can make the solution several days before to get
   a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour and tapioca
   starch. Turn the mixer to "stir" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix. 

3. While running the mixer on stir, add two thirds of your water mixture slowly,
   in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 3
   minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for another
   minute, until small clumps begin to form.

5. Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let
   this rest for 1 hour at room temperature. *Unlike with all other recipes, you
   can actually skip this, as kitakata noodles are often made by hand in the
   same day*. 

6. Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going
   through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and
   fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet
   it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and
   not ragged. 

7. After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30 minutes. *You may also skip this, though the noodles will
   degrade in quality in the fridge if you don't use them quickly*. 

8. Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired
   thickness using the pasta machine, using potato or cornstarch as you go to
   prevent sticking. 

9. Grab a sheet around 12 inches long, and cut into noodles approximately 3 mm
   wide. You can do this by hand, or by a cutter. 

10. Take the noodles and compress them together, sort of like making a snowball,
    then detangle them, to create a wavy, crinkled pattern. 

11. Bundle the noodles into 150 g portions and place them in a sealable bag. You
    may use the noodles immediately, or store them in the fridge for a few days.
