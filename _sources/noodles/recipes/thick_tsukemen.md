# Thick Tsukemen Noodle 

This noodle uses a bit of whole wheat flour in addition to bread flour. This whole wheat accomplishes a few things:

1. **adds more wheat flavor**: A lot of the flavor of wheat is captured in the bran
   and germ, rather than the clean endosperm. In normal white flour, the bran
   and germ are excluded, resulting in a clean, simple profile that is
   versatile. But for wheat flavor, sometimes it's good to add a bit of the
   brown stuff. We're not looking for full-on whole wheat noodles, but this will
   add flavor no doubt.

2. **changes the color/appearance**: The bran and germ contain the majority of the
   mineral content in the wheat berry. In flour milling, this mineral content is
   called "ash," and higher ash flours tend to have a browner hue. For this
   tsukemen, I wanted to increase the ash content of the dry ingredients
   slightly, just from a visual perspective. Rather than searching for high ash
   flour, this move gets you pretty close (and some nice flecks too).

3. **reduces some gluten formation**: Because tsukemen noodles are so thick and so
   hydrated, you don't want a large amount of gluten. Developing the gluten too
   much will cause the noodles to be extremely, unpleasantly chewy, and require
   extensive cooking time.

## Ingredients (per portion)
 
* 94 g all-purpose flour (10.5% protein by weight)
* 6 g whole wheat all-purpose flour
* 40 g water
* 1 g baked soda or powdered kansui (60% potassium, 40% sodium)
* 1 g salt

## Steps
 
1. Add kansui powder and salt to the water, dissolve completely. If using both
   sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, add them one at a time. Go slowly,
   stir constantly until clear. This will take a while, but eventually, the
   contents will dissolve. You can make the solution several days before to get
   a jumpstart, just hold the liquid in an airtight container.

2. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add your flour. Turn the mixer
   to "stir" and run for 30 seconds to aerate the mix. 

3. While running the mixer on stir, add two thirds of your water mixture slowly,
   in an even stream. Let the mixer stir the flour and water mixture for 3
   minutes.

4. Add in the remaining water mixture with the mixer running, run for another
   minute, until small clumps begin to form.

5. Turn off the mixer, and add the mixture to a sealable bag. Close, and let
   this rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Don't skip this.

6. Knead it, by using an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going
   through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd. Take the dough and
   fold it, sheeting under the 2nd widest setting, then fold it again and sheet
   it under the widest setting. Repeat this until the sheet is quite smooth and
   not ragged. 

7. After kneading, put the dough back in the plastic bag, and rest at room temp
   for another 30 minutes.

8. Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes, and roll out to desired
   thickness using the pasta machine, using potato or cornstarch as you go to
   prevent sticking. For this noodle, rolling to around 3mm thick is ideal. 

9. Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. 3.0 mm by 3.0 mm is ideal for an
   extra thick noodle. 

10. Bundle the noodles into 180--200 g portions and place them in a sealable bag.
    Put the bag in the fridge and allow it to rest for at least a day.
