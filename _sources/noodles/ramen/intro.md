# What is a Ramen Noodle?

Regarding the etymology, the term "ramen" has a vague history, with some
claiming it's derived from the Chinese "la-mien" hand-pulled noodles, and others
telling folk-etymology stories where a cook in Sapporo called out "Hao-la" when
he was done making his noodle soup, to tell waitstaff to get the bowl.
Regardless of the origins of the name, ramen noodles are not the same as
hand-pulled noodles in how they are produced. Attempting to hand pull a ramen
noodle dough will result in some serious frustration. 

In terms of definitions, then, ramen noodles must contain both of the following
ingredients: wheat, and kansui (the alkaline salts), and this is formally
defined by the Japanese government to sell a noodle under the name, "ramen."
Udon, rice noodles, pasta, while all delicious, aren't ramen, and the contents
of this chapter specifically refers to ramen. Despite what appears to be intense
rigidity, plenty of complexity can be incorporated in ramen noodle making, like
using additional additives, or playing with the amounts of wheat and kansui. But
these two ingredients are pretty set in stone. All of the recipes in this book,
therefore, contain both wheat and alkaline salts.
