## Tantanmen Tare

Tantanmen, derived from dan dan noodles from China, is a sesame and spice based
dish. This method is extremely simple, but feel free to incorporate other common
ingredients, such as Sichuan pickles. Ironically, this tare rarely contains
large quantities of umami-building ingredients, but it's still delicious. 

### Ingredients (for one bowl)

* 35 g soy sauce
* 3 g rice wine vinegar
* 25 g ground sesame (either tahini or nerigoma)

### Steps
 
1. Combine the above ingredients, whisking until fully incorporated, at the
   bottom of a serving bowl. You can, alternatively, up the amount by scaling
   the amounts as needed.
