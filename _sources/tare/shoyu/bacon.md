# Bacon Shoyu Tare
 
In the desire to remove some of the common Japanese ingredients from ramen, I
decided to swap Katsuobushi with Bacon. The bacon dashi provides smoke and some
fermented tang but does not provide inosinic acid, so some supplementation of
MSG is helpful. 

## Ingredients

* 225 g soy sauce
* 50 g mirin
* 20 g brown sugar
* 225 g {ref}`bacon-dashi` 
* 40 g salt
* 5 g msg

## Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in a pot.
2. Bring to a boil to dissolve the salt, sugar, and MSG. 
3. Allow tare to cool, then use it as needed. 
4. If not used immediately, store in the refrigerator for up to a month.

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.
