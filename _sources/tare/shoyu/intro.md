# Shoyu Tare

Shoyu, or soy sauce, is the oldest style of tare. Ramen doesn't exist without
this one, because the origins of ramen lie in Japanese cooks re-imagining
Chinese soups with local tastes in mind. It was the late 19th century in Japan,
and meat was rarely consumed by locals. You have an influx of immigrants, many
Chinese, who cooked meat-based dishes. According to [*Slurp! A Social and
Culinary History of Ramen*][slurp], the story goes that Japanese cooks, put off
by the smell of meat and garlic found in these foreign soups, wanted to adopt
these Chinese noodle soups for a more local audience {cite}`kushner_slurp_2014`.
To temper those unfamiliar and unsavory meat scents, they used soy sauceâ€”and
thus the first iteration of ramen was born.

There are many variants of shoyu tare because often it is the most multi-purpose
seasoning. Typically I follow a baseline ratio of:

* 450 g soy sauce
* 50 g mirin (for sweetness) 
* 30--45 g umami building ingredients (kombu, fish, etc) 

I enjoy doing a cold soak with the umami ingredients to extract as much flavor
as possible from them. The tare needs punch, so a prolonged steep is helpful in
my experience. 

If you'd like something less soy-forward, simply swap the soy sauce with some
amount of water, and add salt. For every 20 g of soy sauce you remove, add 1--2
g salt (depending on preferences). This assumes Soy sauce is around 14% salt by
weight. 

Sake and sugar can be added to further provide complexity and sweetness, but the
idea, in my opinion, is to find a template you enjoy for your tare, and stick
with it when designing new recipes. Adjusting too many variables can result in
difficulty in understanding what works and what does not.
