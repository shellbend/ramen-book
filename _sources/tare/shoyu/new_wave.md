# New Wave Shoyu Tare

The new wave shoyu tare style is denoted by primarily focusing on soy sauce as
the flavoring of the dish, but using exceptionally high-quality soy sauces. Look
for soy sauces that are traditionally made. Cheaper soy sauces use artificially
induced hydrolysis to assist in breaking down the beans to speed up production.
Although the fermentation process is faster, this step also prevents other
secondary flavors from being produced that otherwise occur in traditional
methods. Some soy sauces are fermented in large barrels, adding complexity. When
in doubt, look for Japanese soy sauces, or soy sauces made with "marudaizu"
(i.e. whole beans). These soy sauces undergo longer fermentation times and
therefore have additional complexity.
