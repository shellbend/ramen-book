# Lighter Shoyu Tare

When you want to keep the color of the broth lighter in appearance, this tare is
the one to go for. It uses a light soy sauce (usukuchi soy sauce) in place of
more commonly found dark soy sauce. It isn't as flavorful as a standard shoyu,
but it has nice elements, and the color is lighter.
 
## Ingredients

* 225 g water
* 225 g usukuchi soy sauce
* 15 g kombu
* 20 g niboshi
* 15 g katsuobushi
* 20 g sake
* 30 g mirin
* 30 g brown sugar

## Steps

1. Combine the water, soy sauce, kombu, and niboshi in a sealed container.

2. Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.

3. Add the mixture to a small saucepan.

4. Heat the contents to 71 째C/160 째F, hold for 10 minutes. 

5. Remove the kombu and discard.

6. Bring 180F (or just below a boil) and hold for 15 minutes. 

7. Add the katsuobushi, hold at 82 째C/180 째F for 5 more minutes. 

8. Strain and reserve liquid on the side.

9. In a new clean pot, add your mirin, sake, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil,
   and simmer for 5 minutes.

    fridge for up to 6 months.
