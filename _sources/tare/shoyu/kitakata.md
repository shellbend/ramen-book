# Kitakata Shoyu Tare
 
This recipe comes from Shichisai, who uses extremely high-quality soy sauce,
that you or I probably don't have. Just use the best soy sauce you have, and
blend accordingly. The steps itself are incredibly simple, but this tare is less
flavor-forward than other variants due to the boil and additional salt content.

## Ingredients

* 200 g {ref}`dashi`
* 300 g soy sauce
* 20 g small niboshi (such as iriko)
* 40 g sugar
* 40 g salt

## Steps

1. Combine the above in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil to dissolve the
   salt and sugar.

2. Once fully dissolved, allow tare to cool, then strain.

3. If not used immediately, store in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.  

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.
