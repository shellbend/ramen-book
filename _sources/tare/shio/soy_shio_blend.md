# Soy/Shio Blend Tare

As mentioned earlier, some shio tare recipes contain soy sauce. There's no way I
could leave you hanging, so this is one of them. It's effectively a blend of
many tares listed above, making it a great all-purpose tare for creamy soups and
light soups alike. 

## Ingredients

* 7 g kombu
* 75 g mirin
* 50 g sake
* 25 g white wine
* 75 g white soy sauce
* 25 g usukuchi soy sauce
* 10 g salt
* 5 g MSG (optional)
* 25 g niboshi
* Sesame oil for toasting
* 150 g water
* 10 g katsuobushi

## Steps

1. Soak the kombu in the mirin, sake, and white wine, for at least 6 hours and
   up to 24, in the fridge.
2. When ready to make, add the kombu and steeping liquid to a saucepot. Cook on
   medium heat until the cooking liquid registers at 160 F degrees. Hold here
   for 5 minutes.
3. Remove the kombu, boil slightly to remove some residual alcohol, around 5
   minutes.
4. Add the soy sauces and salts. Reserve this liquid on the side.
5. In the now-empty pot, add the niboshi and sesame oil to a pot. Cook until
   fragrant on medium-high heat, around 40 seconds.
6. Add the water, bring to 82 °C/180 °F.
7. Add the katsuobushi and steep for 10 minutes.
8. Strain this liquid, adding it to the one in step 4.
9. Combine the two strained liquids. 
10. Store in the fridge until ready to use. Keeps for around 6 months.

Add 30 mL of tare per 300 mL soup.
