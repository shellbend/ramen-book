# White Wine Chicken Shio

This recipe is heavily adapted from a shio recipe I found some time ago in a
[tare book][ramen_2011] {cite}`ramen_2011`. It's nice, very sake and wine
forward, which you may or may not like. Good for particularly chicken-forward
soups, but not bad in a tonkotsu either.

## Ingredients

* 15 g kombu
* 150 g mirin
* 75 g sake
* 75 g dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)
* 500 g chicken chintan
* 250 g ground chicken
* 100 g salt
* 10 g msg

## Steps

1. The night before, combine the kombu, mirin, sake, and white wine in a
   container. Place in the fridge and steep overnight, or up to 24 hours.

2. When ready to make the tare, place the contents of step 1 in a saucepan and
   heat to 71° C/160 °F. Hold for 5 minutes.

3. Remove the kombu from the liquid, add in the chicken chintan and the ground
   chicken. Cook, mixing frequently, at a boil until the chicken is thoroughly
   cooked, around 5 minutes.

4. Strain the liquid, reserving the cooked ground chicken for another use.

5. Place the strained liquid back into a pot and add the salt and MSG. Cook
   until dissolved, whisking to incorporate, around 2--3 minutes.

6. Allow to cool, and store in the fridge for up to 6 months.

Add 30 mL of tare per 350 mL soup.
