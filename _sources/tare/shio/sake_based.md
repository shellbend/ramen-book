# Sake-based Shio Tare

For some additional complexity, this tare uses kombu for flavor, as well as a
few other sources of subtle aromatics. Sake contains trace amounts of glutamate,
adding to the umami profile, as well as a variety of other aromatics as a result
of the brewing process. 

## Ingredients

* 400 g water
* 15 g kombu
* 50 g mirin
* 100 g sake
* 50 g salt
* 10 g msg

## Steps

1. Combine the water, kombu, and mirin in a sealed container.
2. Place in the fridge and rest at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.
3. When ready, heat the contents to 71 °C/160 °F and steep for 10 minutes.

   of alcohol subsides.
