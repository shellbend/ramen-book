# Kara Miso (Spicy Miso) 

This recipe is a variant of the standard miso approach but uses additional
ingredients to highlight the actual pepper flavor, rather than merely adding
spice. 

## Ingredients

* 1 red bell pepper, deseeded
* 2 habanero chilies, deseeded
* 140 g onion, pureed in a food processor
* 7 g garlic, grated/minced
* 6 g ginger, grated/minced
* 300 g white miso
* 180 g Tezukuri or mugi miso
* 80 g red miso
* 10 g mirin
* 30 g soy sauce
* 5 g sesame oil
* 14 g tahini
* 8 g Tobanjan
* 60 g Gochujang
* 0.5 g smoked paprika (approx ½ tsp)
* 1 tbsp togarashi (this is for flavor, we're also adding spice to the bottom of
  the bowl)

## Steps
 
1. Blend the red bell pepper, deseeded habaneros in a food processor until fully
   pureed and liquidy.
2. Combine with half of the large onion pulp (about ¼ of an onion).
3. Add this liquidy paste to a small saucepan or skillet, and cook over medium
   heat, until the majority of the water has evaporated and begins to
   caramelize, around 10--15 minutes.
4. Add the contents from step 2 to a bowl. Combine with the remaining
   ingredients. Whisk fully to incorporate. This tare will keep for up to 12
   months.

Add 70 g of tare per 350 mL soup.
