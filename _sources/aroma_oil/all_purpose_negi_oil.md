# All-Purpose Scallion (Negi) Oil

If this is your first exposure to aroma oil, this is an easy way to see how the
process works, and it's versatile for several ramen styles without requiring any
complex ingredients. It works on lighter bowls and more rich ones. As a bonus,
you can use this stuff in all sorts of dishes. Fried rice, sear chicken in it,
toss it with a salad. All tasty. 

## Ingredients

* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) neutral oil, like vegetable oil
* One bunch of scallion whites, trimmed of their ends. 

## Steps

1. In a small saucepan, add the oil and scallions. 

2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the scallions take on a
   light golden hue and smell fragrant around 10--15 minutes. 

3. Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot and allow it to cool. 

4. Strain and transfer oil to a melt-resistant container. If not used
   immediately, store in the fridge for up to 6 months.
