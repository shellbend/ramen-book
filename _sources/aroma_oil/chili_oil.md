# Chili Oil

Chili oil is a relative newcomer to the ramen world, usually used in
Chinese-flavor inspired ramen dishes like tantanmen, but it's definitely in line
with what I'd consider an aroma oil. I like to use animal fats in mine and
combine them with some aromatics, but you can use any variants you like. This is
classically used in tantanmen, but is also good for adding some nice chili
flavor and heat to other kinds of ramen.

## Ingredients
 
* 250 mL (approx. 1 cup) fat of choice (I typically use pork lard, though
  vegetable oil also works here) 
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1 5 cm/2 in piece of ginger, sliced into  0.5 cm/0.25 in coins
* Half of a small onion
* 3 tbsp coarsely ground togarashi 
* 4 dried Chinese chilis
* 1--2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns

## Steps
 
1. In a small saucepan, add the fat, garlic, ginger, and onion.

2. Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
   ingredients take on a light golden hue, and smell fragrant, around 15
   minutes. 

3. Add in your togarashi, Chinese chilis, and Sichuan peppercorns. 

4. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and let the ingredients steep in this oil
   for 30 minutes. 
   
5. Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the
   fridge for up to 6 months.
