# Ginger and Onion Pork Lard 

I particularly like this one for miso variants, though it's good on shoyu too. 

## Ingredients

* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) rendered pork lard
* One half white onion, cut into large pieces
* 4 garlic cloves
* One one-inch piece of ginger, peeled, sliced into 0.5 cm/0.25 in coins. 

## Steps
 
1. In a small saucepan, add the oil, onion, garlic, and ginger. 

2. Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
   ingredients take on a light golden hue, and smell fragrant, around 15
   minutes. 

3. Remove from the heat, reserve in the pot, and allow it to cool. 

4. Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep in the
   fridge for up to 6 months.
