# Putting It All Together

The assembly of ramen is easy but requires some planning, as there are many
components. Below is a framework for planning, and eventually assembling, a
single bowl of ramen. You'll notice that the components are not made on the same
day. I find that spreading out the work prevents this process from being too
overwhelming. Ramen is designed to be prepared in advance anyway, with most of
the components improving as they mature over time in the fridge.

## Mise en Place

Ramen is all about mise en place, the French phrase that means "everything in
its place". In ramen, this means everything is ready to be put into the bowl. In
most ramen shops, all components are fully prepped/cooked in advance, so a ramen
cook can assemble the dish quickly. Usually, assembly only requires heating some
soup and cooking some noodles. 

But you should know, as a broad method, it's best to break up the process over
time. Thinking slightly like a chef helps when making ramen to prevent it from
being overwhelming. This means breaking down the prep into manageable pieces and
storing them in your fridge gradually. No ramen chef makes every component all
at once.

## Preparation Process

This process will break down a hypothetical scenario for a shoyu ramen to be
served on a Sunday. Given the cooking time for some of the components, the
weekend/days off are good times, much like a household prepares a stew on
Sunday. But this general approach will work for any bowl of ramen you wind up
making.

### Sunday, one week out (around 1--2 hours of work)

* Cook the tare. Usually, this involves soaking some items in soy or water, then
  heating them. Assembly is minimal; store in the fridge after cooking. Tare,
  broadly, can be kept in the fridge for very long periods due to its high salt
  content.

* Cook the aroma oil if possible, store in the fridge until ready to use. If the
  fat comes from the soup, you'll need to wait, but this is helpful, as it's one
  less component you'll need to prepare.

* Make or purchase the noodles. For first-timers, I recommend buying the noodles
  over making them. But ramen noodles get better as they age in the fridge, and
  can stay in the fridge for up to two weeks while still being safe to eat.

### Saturday, the day before (around 6--10 hours of work, mostly idle waiting for things to cook)

* Prep the soup. If you have one, use a pressure cooker to save time. 
* Cook chashu. Since chashu needs to usually be cold to be sliced, you can make
  it in advance. Feel free to freeze leftovers for later use.
* Cook and steep eggs: eggs need around a day or so to steep (especially with a
  diluted brine of 100 mL water, 20 mL soy sauce, and 10 mL mirin or so, where
  eggs can sit for days at a time without over-curing). You can cook these while
  the chashu and soup go.

### Sunday, the day of (only 30 minutes or so required)

* Prep your toppings: slice the scallions, cut nori, etc. 
* Assemble your bowl

With this approach, basically all of the work is done before the actual serving
day. Most of the days only have an hour or so of actual intense cooking. Even
though some of the processes may take a long time, they are not laborious the
entire way. Soups may take hours, but there's a lot of downtime between
simmering and straining. Otherwise, this plan makes the labor involved far more
digestible.
