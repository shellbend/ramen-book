# Pork Soboro

Soboro is a common ramen topping in tantanmen, but it's also great over rice,
stuffed into lettuce wraps, or on its own with a spoon, if you're feeling extra
gluttonous. 

## Ingredients

* 15 mL (approx 1 tbsp) vegetable oil
* Half of one white onion, diced finely
* 0.5 kg ground pork (or around 1 lb)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2  0.5 cm/0.25 in coins of ginger, minced
* 30 mL (approx. 2 tbsp) soy sauce
* 45 mL (approx. 3 tbsp) sweet bean paste
* 15 mL (approx. 1 tbsp) mirin
* 15 mL (approx. 1 tbsp) sake
* salt to taste

## Steps

1. In a large saute pan, sweat the onion over medium heat in the oil until
   translucent, 3--5 minutes.

2. Increase the heat to high, and add in the pork. Cook, stirring and breaking
   up clumps, until starting to brown.

3. Add in the garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant, around 1 minute.

4. Add in remaining ingredients. Cook until the pork is glossy, fully cooked,
   and flavorful. Adjust seasonings as necessary.
