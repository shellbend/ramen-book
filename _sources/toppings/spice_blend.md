# Spice Blend

I don't know whether this counts as a "topping" or not. I like to add it both to
the bottom of the bowl and also on top of the soup after the noodles have been
added. Will the ramen gods forsake me for mischaracterizing a spice blend? Eh,
maybe I'm overthinking it. 

In any case, heat comes in several forms in ramen. You can add chili oil,
togarashi powder (ground Japanese chilis), or fermented pastes like Gochujang
and Tobanjan. I like to make a blend of spices for spicier variants of ramen.
Below is a standard spice blend I use:

## Ingredients

* 8 dried Chinese chilies, whole
* 6 g togarashi (approx 2 tbsp) 
* 3 g whole Sichuan peppercorns (approx. 1 tbsp) 
* Optional: 2 g white peppercorns (approx. 2 tsp) 

## Steps
 
1. In a spice mill, blend the above ingredients one by one. Combine in a small
   bowl. Reserve until needed. 

There are countless other toppings, these are just a handful of the most common
ones. Toppings give chefs an incredible amount of creativity, and you can really
go nuts.
