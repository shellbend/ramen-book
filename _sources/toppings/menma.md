# Menma

The reality is that menma in the US is hard to make. Menma requires a specific
type of bamboo that has been dried and lacto-fermented. These are effectively
unavailable to home cooks (though some restaurant distributors do sell them in
bulk). 

If you can get your hands on these, the process is also somewhat annoying, but
doable. Otherwise, some asian supermarkets sell prepared menma.

## Ingredients

* 500 g lacto fermented bamboo shoots
* 100 g mirin
* 15 g sugar
* 20 g soy sauce
* Sesame oil, as needed

## Steps

1. The night before, submerge the bamboo to a bowl of cold water and allow them
   to soak in the fridge for 12--24 hours.

2. Drain the bamboo thoroughly, set aside.

3. In a saute pan, add your bamboo, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce. 

4. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is slightly absorbed, 10--15
   minutes.

5. Add the sesame oil to coat.

6. Transfer the menma to a container and allow them to soak for 24 hours. The
   menma will keep over time.

You may find some additional "quick" methods for making menma with canned
bamboo. At this time, I don't have a recipe I think is a sufficient substitute
for the real stuff.
