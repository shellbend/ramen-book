# Wood Ear Mushroom

This is a common topping in southern-style paitan soups, particularly tonkotsu.
It is bafflingly easy to make. They're primarily for texture contrast, as they
have little to no flavor. 

## Ingredients

* Dried wood ear mushrooms
* Water

## Steps

1. Cover the dried wood ear mushrooms with boiling water.
2. Allow to steep for 15 minutes, or until rehydrated.
3. Strain and reserve as needed. You can optionally cut into thin strips if
   desired.
