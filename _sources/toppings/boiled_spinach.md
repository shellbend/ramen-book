# Boiled Spinach

Boiling spinach is not hard, and it's also a common topping, particularly in
shoyu. Since the soup is often amply seasoned, I find the water used for cooking
here does not need salt. Feel free to add it if you so choose. 

## Ingredients

* Spinach (ideally with root attached) 
* Water for boiling
* Ice water for shocking

## Steps

1. Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.
2. Add the spinach, starting from the root end. Cook for 20--30 seconds.
3. Strain spinach and transfer to ice water to stop cooking.
4. Wring out the spinach of its residual water, shaping it into a firm log.
5. Cut the log into 2-inch pieces, then reserve as needed.
