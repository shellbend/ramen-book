# Chashu

Alongside eggs, chashu is perhaps the other most common topping for ramen.
Chashu is almost always a slow-cooked, decadently tender slice of pork, usually
from either the belly or the shoulder, but it can also be from the loin for
leaner variants. There are several approaches to making chashu: 

1. Several shops cook the pork in broth and boil it until tender, usually 2--3
   hours. Then they reserve it in a sauce (or tare) of some kind.
2. Some shops perform a braise, tossing the pork into a tare directly and
   boiling until cooked. Then this tare gets used for other dishes. 
3. Some shops just straight-up roast their pork, for that excellent caramelized
   flavor.
4. More sophisticated shops often use sous vide, or temperature-controlled water
   baths, for optimal precision.

All of these techniques have their pros and cons:

How you finish the chashu is also a common point of contention. Searing,
reheating, throwing the slices into the soup cold, you can do whatever you like
with whatever combination you desire. It'll probably be delicious no matter how
you finish preparing the meat, but I recommend making sure the pieces you use
are similar in size. That'll make the presentation and cooking much more
consistent.
