# Sous Vide 

Sous vide is an incredible tool for chashu. It allows you to produce meat that
is both exceptionally tender, well structured, and gorgeously pink, while still
being fully cooked and safe to eat. This is a fantastic way to make chashu, and
most high-end shops are pivoting to this approach, because it allows them to
cook with marvelous consistency.

It also allows you to store the pork in the bag well in advance before use.
Simply remove the bag from the water bath, chill the bag in an ice bath, and
then reserve in the fridge. This pork should keep well for several weeks,
provided you keep it in the vacuum-sealed bag, as the pork itself will be
pasteurized and won't be exposed to oxygen. 

The cooking liquid is practically identical to what was used in the braising
recipe. 

## Ingredients

* Pork belly (weight is not important here)
* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) mirin
* 125 mL (approx. 0.5 cup) soy sauce
* 250 mL (approx. 1 cup) water
* 12.5 g (1 tbsp) brown sugar
* 60 mL (approx. 0.25 cup) sake
* Ice water for shocking

## Steps
 
1. Preheat a water bath to 79 째C/175 째F using a sous vide water circulator.

2. Sear the pork belly on all sides on high heat in a pan until golden brown,
   then place in a sturdy bag (ideally one used for a vacuum sealer). 

3. Deglaze the pan with the remaining ingredients, then reserve this liquid and
   allow it to cool.

4. When the liquid has cooled, add it to the bag with the pork. 

5. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible.

6. Cook the pork belly sous vide for 7--12 hours. 

7. Remove the meat from the bath, and add to the ice water to chill quickly.
   Reserve in the fridge until needed, then slice as desired. 


Now, there are many temperatures and times you could select based on preference.
I like chashu to be pretty melty, but still with some structure so that it
doesn't fall apart in the chopsticks, so I sous vide at a relatively high
temperature. Others may prefer a more steak-like, or firm chashu. Lower
temperatures (say, 68 째C/155 째F) for a longer period (24--36 hours) will give a
more steaky texture if that's what you're looking for.
