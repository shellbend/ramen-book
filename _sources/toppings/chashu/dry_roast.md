# Dry Roasting

In some shops, the pork is hung in a small chimney like charcoal or gas grills
until it is cooked. Despite the name "chashu" roughly referring to Chinese roast
pork, the actual act of dry roasting chashu is relatively rare. But it can be
delicious. 

In dry roasting, some precaution needs to be taken into account to avoid
over-cooking the meat. Unlike in a water-based cooking method, where the
temperature never gets above boiling, dry roasting can quickly get portions of
the meat past the temperature where connective tissue breaks down before the
collagen has time to turn into gelatin, resulting in dry, chalky meat, that is
essentially ruined. 

To compensate, chashu needs to be roasted at a lower temperature for a very long
time, upwards of 5--6 hours. Meat cooked this way is never tender the way a
braised piece of meat is, but it has deep, intense, caramelized notes on the
exterior of the meat. 

The method is effectively the same for pork belly or shoulder. Use whichever cut
you prefer.

## Ingredients

* Pork belly
* Seasoning (typically, salt, and pepper, followed by a glaze of some kind,
  typically soy sauce-based) 

## Steps
 
1. Preheat the oven to 150 °C/300 °F

2. On a baking sheet with a wire rack set in it, add the pork belly and season
   generously. 

3. Roast until the interior of the meat reaches 91 °C/195 °F, anywhere from
   5--10 hours depending on the size of the roast. 

4. Remove the pork, increase the heat of the oven to 230 °C/450 °F

5. When the oven has come to the higher temperature, coat the pork in the glaze,
   and roast for 5--10 minutes or until caramelized and seared to your liking.
