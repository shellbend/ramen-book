# Bacon Dashi

This idea is blatantly ripped off from David Chang and Peter Meehan's cookbook,
["Momofuku: a Cookbook"][momofuku] {cite}`chang_momofuku_2009`. I won't even
pretend to have come up with the idea. It's excellent for those who struggle to
find Japanese ingredients, the bacon providing smoke. 

## Ingredients

* 1 L cold water
* 10 g kombu
* 100 g bacon (raw, preferably thick cut or end pieces from a whole slab) 

## Steps

1. Add all ingredients to a pot. 

2. Heat over medium-low heat until just below a simmer, around 80 °C/176 °F.

3. Turn off the heat and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.

4. Remove the kombu.

5. Bring up to a simmer, then turn off the heat again, cover, and allow to steep
   until flavored to your liking, around 30 minutes.

6. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve until needed.

These dashi recipes will pop up on occasion in the next soups. But onto the main
methods for Chintan and Paitan.
