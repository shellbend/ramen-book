# Dashi 

Before we dive into styles of soup, there's a critical soup component that needs
a little more detail and needs to be made ahead of time. Ramen chefs often add
liberal quantities of this ingredient to their soups, and that is also true for
the recipes in this book. I'm talking about that subtle but umami amplifying
stock, used in all sorts of other Japanese soups, dashi.

Dashi is a cornerstone of Japanese cooking and it would be a disservice to not
mention it in some capacity in this book. The term "dashi" is often used as a
catchall term in modern Japanese for soup, but most typically refers to a soup
made from kombu and dried fish products. An entire book could be written on
dashi. In fact, [one by Heston Blumenthal][blumenthal_dashi_2009] has already
been written {cite}`blumenthal_dashi_2009`. Dashi has been the subject of
intense discussion, debate, and research, due to its importance to the Japanese
lexicon of food, and it's remarkable ability to add a meaty sensation on the
palate. 

Ajinomoto, a prominent supplier of ingredients used in cooking, credits dashi as
the source of inspiration for the discovery of umami, and in turn, the various
components that create umami (which we'll cover in the tare section more fully).
Specific temperatures, times, and approaches are touted by various chefs and
scholars on how to extract the most umami and flavor from core ingredients, but
they vary considerably. [One study by Mouritsen et al.][mouritsen_seaweeds_2012]
showed that holding kombu in water at a temperature of around 60 °C/140 °F for
45 minutes extracted the same amount of umami producing compounds as boiling the
kombu {cite}`mouritsen_seaweeds_2012`. [Others claim][muraoka_bringing_2019]
that soft water improves the extraction {cite}`muraoka_bringing_2019`, while
Mouritsen et al. did not show that this was true. [David Arnold's work with
kombu][arnold_umami_2010] suggests that steeping kombu in cold water before
cooking using sous vide can also provide ample extraction of umami ingredients,
though he used an operating temperature of 65 °C {cite}`arnold_umami_2010`.
Other recipes, such as [Ivan Orkin's][orkin_ivan_2013], insist on using 80
°C/176 °F as the optimal cooking temperature {cite}`orkin_ivan_2013`. 

This can be very confusing. Who is right here? In general, I don't fuss about
the specifics, I think you can make good quality dashi even with tap water.
Excessive heat does impact the final result considerably, so I try to avoid
boiling dashi ingredients. Much like tea, extremely high temperatures can
extract unwanted flavors from these ingredients, and it's best to err on the
side of caution (even if Mouritsen et al. are correct). But I don't think you
need to constantly monitor the temperature, especially in ramen applications. 

Dashi can be added to soup, but I find that it's easier to add the ingredients
used in dashi to soup directly. The ingredients used in dashi add fantastic
complexity to ramen. Katsuobushi is smoky, niboshi is fishy and pungent, clams
are briny and sweet, and kombu is oceanic. For simplicity, I often just add
these ingredients at the end of the cook, much like with other aromatic
components. By the time these ingredients are added, the soup is no longer
boiling and is an appropriate temperature for most extractions. Still, you'll
have to play around with what works for you. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to add dashi to soup, rather than adding just the
ingredients, below are a few dashi recipes. They are by no means exhaustive
(again, dashi is inherently complex stuff with many variations). Dashi can also
be used to thin out thick soups in a pinch or will be used as part of the soup
technique known as "double soup" (more on this one later).
