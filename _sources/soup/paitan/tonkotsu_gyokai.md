# Tonkotsu Gyokai Soup

This is a riff on tonkotsu that incorporates fish elements. Packed with umami,
it's also decadently rich. 

## Ingredients

* 2 kg/4.4 lb neck bones
* 2 kg/4.4 lb femurs, split to expose the marrow
* 6 L water
* Half of a pig trotter
* 1 onion 
* 10 garlic cloves
* 1 2-inch piece of ginger
* 20 g kombu
* 30 g niboshi
* 30 g katsuobushi
* 30--50 g gyofun (fish powder) 

## Steps
 
1. The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones
   and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware
   container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting tonkotsu
   is whiter in appearance).

2. When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water.
   Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the
   top of the pot. Do this for 15--20 minutes, or until little scum is rising.
   The scum goes through several phases here, you'll know when the scum is
   pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white tonkotsu, don't
   skip it, and don't end it prematurely.

3. Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid.

4. Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty
   looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices. 

5. Add your now clean bones to a pot.

6. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently and adding water to
   ensure bones are covered. 

7. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, kombu, niboshi, and katsuobushi to the soup,
   turning off the heat, letting it steep for one hour. 

8. Strain the soup.

9. Add one-quarter of the soup to a blender with the gyofun and blend on high
   for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid
   splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. 

10. Combine with the remaining soup, and reserve the soup as needed.
