# Jiro Style Tonkotsu Soup

The soup that I enjoy In Jiro is a mix between a paitan and a chintan, but feel
free to make it really clear, or really emulsified, the process is the same both
ways, you'll just finish it differently.

## Ingredients

* 2 kg/4.4 lb femur bones
* 4 L water
* 1.5 kg/3.3 lbs pork shoulder, boneless, cut into 2--3 inch wide strips. You can
  also use belly, the method is identical
* 0.5 kg/1.1 lb backfat
* 1 3-inch piece of ginger
* 1 head of garlic, split
* 1 onion, quartered
* 1 bunch of scallions

## Steps

1. Optional, to remove funk, blanch the bones by adding them to cold water, and
   bringing to a boil. Most jiro shops avoid this and just skim during phase 2. 

2. Add bones to 4 L water, cook 5 hours at a simmer

3. Add pork shoulder and back fat to the pot, cook an additional 2 hours

4. Remove now cooked chashu and backfat, reserve until needed (for chashu, add
   to {ref}`tare <easy-meat-shoyu-tare>`, for back fat, chop into pieces and
   place in a container until needed).

5. Add garlic, onion, ginger, bring contents to a rapid boil and cook for 30
   min.

6. Poke femurs interiors with a chopstick or small knife to help release marrow
   (and allow it to fall back into the pot)

7. Add scallions, boil another 15--30 min.

8. Strain. Should yield around 3 quarts, add water to get to this. Chill soup
   thoroughly.

9. For a clearer soup, skim and discard fat that has solidified on top of the
   soup after chilling. For a cloudier soup, keep all fat, and use an immersion
   blender or jar blender to combine. For in between, remove some fat. You get
   the idea.
