# Eifukucho Taishoken style Chintan

This recipe is derived from a [video][] I found some time ago showing some of the
ratios used at Eifukucho Taishoken, a legendary ramen shop in Tokyo, one of the
oldest continually operating shops in Japan, and is in general indicative of
old-school ramen from Tokyo, heavy with pork and fish products. They focus on a
fish-forward soup, with lots of vegetables, and a relatively low quantity of
pork. The soup is simple to produce but maddeningly complex. Of note, the final
soup is noticeably murky, but this isn't a bug, it's a feature. Old school soups
are not as clear as modern interpretations. 

## Ingredients

* 4 L water
* 1 kg pork bones
* 375 g niboshi
* 60 g katsuobushi
* 60 g Sababushi
* 37 g Kombu
* 140 g onion (1/2 onion)
* 4 scallions
* 8 garlic cloves
* 160 g potato (about half a potato) 
* 10 g ginger (1--2 inch piece)

## Steps

1. Add the pork bones to a stockpot, cover with water.

2. Bring up to a boil over high heat. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to
   the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20
   minutes.

3. Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (around 88
   °C/190 °F), 7 hours.

4. In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour at
   below simmer.

5. Strain the soup and reserve until needed. 

```{note}
This soup is unique in that, due to the extremely high quantity of fish, a
lower salinity tare, or less tare overall, is preferable. As an example, for 350
mL soup, I would use only 22 mL of the {ref}`new wave tare <new-wave-shoyu-tare>`.
