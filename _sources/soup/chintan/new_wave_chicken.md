# New Wave Chicken Chintan

The new wave of shoyu ramen emerging in Tokyo is based on a very specific trend
of using only chicken, and nothing else. The method is effectively the same as
other chintan applications. 

## Ingredients

* 4 kg/8.8 lb chicken backs (or two small chickens, broken down, breasts
  removed) 
* 4 L water

## Steps

1. Add the chicken to a stockpot, cover with water.

2. Bring the soup up to a boil briefly, skim any scum. Hold here for 5--10
   minutes, or until scum subsides.

3. Reduce heat back down to below simmer (around 88 °C/190 °F), hold for 6
   hours.

4. Strain the soup and hold it until needed.
